<h2><font size=+3> <a name="RTFToC6"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="5" color="#336600">Important 
Notes about as-Salaah 'alaa an-Nabiyy 
- Sending Prayers on the Prophet of 
the Ummah</font> </a></font></h2>
</center>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) 
It can be seen that in most of these ways 
of sending prayers on the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam), there is no mention 
of Ibraaheem separate from his family, 
the wording being, "... as you have sent 
prayers on the family of Ibraaheem." The 
reason for this is that in 'Arabic, the 
family of a man includes the man as well 
as his dependants, e.g. in the words of 
the Exalted, </font> 
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#339933">"</font><font size="3" color="#339933"><tt><b><i><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3.5">Allaah 
has chosen Aadam, Nooh, the family of 
Ibraaheem and the family of 'Imraan above 
all people</font></i></b></tt></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#339933">"</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
<b><font color="#339933">(al-'Imraan 
3:33)</font></b>;</font>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<tt><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3"><b><i><font color="#339933">We 
sent against them a violent tornado with 
showers of stones, except the family 
of Loot - We delivered them by early 
dawn</font></i></b></font></tt>" (Qamar 
54:34); similar is his saying (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam), <b>O Allaah! send 
prayers on the family of Abu Awfaa.</b> 
The phrase Ahl al-Bayt (people of the 
house) is also like this, e.g.</font>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<tt><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3"><b><i><font color="#339933">Allaah's 
grace and His blessings be on you, O 
people of the house</font></i></b></font></tt>" 
(Houd 11:73). Hence, Ibraaheem is included 
in "the family of Ibraaheem".</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah says,</font>
<p> 
<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Most 
of the versions have, 'as you sent prayers 
on the family of Ibraaheem' and 'as you 
sent blessings on the family of Ibraaheem'; 
some have 'Ibraaheem' himself. This is 
because he is the cause of all prayers 
and purifications on them; the rest of 
his family are secondary recipients of 
all that. To show these two points, both 
wordings have been employed separately."</font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Further, there is a well-known question 
among the people of knowledge: about 
the nature of the comparison in his statement, 
"as you sent prayers on ...", for it 
is true that the model for comparison 
is normally superior to the one being 
compared; here, the opposite is the case, 
since Muhammad (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam) is greater than Ibraaheem, and 
so his superiority dictates that the 
prayers requested are more excellent 
than any prayers received or to be received 
by anyone else. The people of knowledge 
have provided many answers to this, and 
these can be found in Fath al-Baari and 
Jalaa' al-Ifhaam. They amount to about 
ten views, all of which are unsubstantiated, 
some weaker than others, except one, 
a well-supported view, and adopted by 
Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn 
al-Qayyim. This view is: "The family 
of Ibraaheem includes many prophets; 
none like them is found in the family 
of Muhammad. Therefore, when prayers 
on the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam) and his family are sought similar 
to that bestowed on Ibraaheem and his 
family, which includes prophets, the 
family of Muhammad receives out of that 
what is appropriate for them. Since the 
family of Muhammad does not reach the 
rank of the prophets, the extra blessings 
and benefit given to the prophets, including 
Ibraaheem, are left for Muhammad (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam). Thus he gains a distinguished 
position which others cannot reach."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Ibn al-Qayyim says, </font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This 
is the best of all the previous views: 
that Muhammad (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam) is one of the family of Ibraaheem; 
in fact, he is the best of the family 
of Ibraaheem, as 'Ali ibn Talhah has 
related from Ibn 'Abbaas (radi Allaahu 
'anhu) about the saying of the Exalted, 
"<i><b><tt><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3" color="#339933">Allaah 
has chosen Aadam, Nooh, the family of 
Ibraaheem and the family of 'Imraan above 
all people</font></tt></b></i>" (aal-'Imraan 
3:33); Ibn 'Abbaas said, "Muhammad is 
among the family of Ibraaheem". This 
is text for the fact that if other prophets 
descended from Ibraaheem are included 
in his family, then the inclusion of 
the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) is more fitting. Hence 
our saying, "... as you sent prayers 
on the family of Ibraaheem", includes 
the prayers sent on him and on the rest 
of the prophets descended from Ibraaheem. 
Allaah has then ordered us to specifically 
send prayers on Muhammad and his family, 
as much as we send prayers on him, along 
with the rest of Ibraaheem's family generally. 
Therefore, the Prophet's family receives 
out of that what is appropriate for them, 
leaving all of the remainder to him (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam). There is no doubt 
that the total amount of prayers received 
by Ibraaheem's family, with the Messenger 
of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
among them, is greater than that received 
by the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam) alone. Therefore, what is sought 
for him is such a great favour, definitely 
superior than that sought for Ibraaheem. 
Hence, the nature of the comparison and 
its consistency become clear. The prayers 
sought for him with these words are greater 
than those requested any other way, since 
what is requested with the supplication 
is that it be as much as the model of 
comparison, and that the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) receive a large portion: 
the comparison dictates that what is 
requested is more than what was given 
to Ibraaheem and others. Thus, the excellence 
and nobility of Muhammad (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam), over and above Ibraaheem 
and his family, which includes many prophets, 
is evident, and is as he deserves. This 
sending of prayers on the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) becomes evidence for 
this excellence of his, and this is no 
more than he deserves. So, may Allaah 
send prayers on him and on his family, 
and send peace on them, many greetings 
of peace, and reward him from our supplications 
better than He has rewarded any prophet 
from his people. O Allaah! send prayers 
on Muhammad, and on the family of Muhammad, 
as you sent prayers on the family of 
Ibraaheem; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, 
Full of Glory. And send blessings on 
Muhammad, and on the family of Muhammad, 
as you sent blessings on the family of 
Ibraaheem; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, 
Full of Glory."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) 
The reader will see that this part of the 
Prayer, with all its different types, is 
always a sending of prayers on the family 
of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam): on his wives and children as well 
as himself. Therefore, it is neither from 
the Sunnah, nor carrying out the Prophet's 
command, to leave it at "O Allaah! send 
prayers on Muhammad" only. Rather, one 
of these complete types of supplication 
must be used, as is reported from his action 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam), whether 
in the first or the last tashahhud. There 
is text about this from Imaam Shaafi'i 
in al-Umm: "The tashahhud in the first 
and second instance is the same thing; 
by 'tashahhud', I mean the bearing of witness 
and the sending of prayers on the Prophet 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam): neither 
will suffice without the other." </font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
In fact, one of the most amazing things 
to arise from this age and its intellectual 
anarchy is that one person, Muhammad 
Is'aaf Nashaasheebi, in his book al-Islaam 
as-Saheeh ("The Correct Islaam"), has 
the audacity to reject the sending of 
prayers on the family of the Prophet 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) when 
sending prayers on him, despite it being 
firmly established in the Saheehs of 
al-Bukhaari and Muslim, and elsewhere, 
on the authority of several Companions, 
e.g. Ka'b ibn 'Ujrah, Abu Humaid as-Saa'idi, 
Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri, Abu Mas'ood al-Ansaari, 
Abu Hurairah and Talhah ibn 'Ubaidullaah! 
In their ahaadeeth, it is found that 
they asked the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam), "How do we send prayers on 
you?", so he taught them this way of 
doing so. Nashaasheebi's argument for 
his view is that Allaah the Exalted did 
not mention anyone else with the Prophet 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) in His 
saying:</font>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<tt><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3"><b><i><font color="#339933">O 
you who believe! Send prayers on him, 
and salute him with all respect</font></i></b></font>.</tt>" 
(Ahzaab 33:56) He then goes on to say 
in his refutation that the Companions 
asked him (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
that question because the meaning of 
"salaah" was known to them as "supplication", 
so they were asking: "How can we supplicate 
to you?"!</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
This is a clear deception, for their 
question was not about the meaning of 
"salaah" on him, in which case he would 
have a point, but it was about the manner 
of doing the salaah on him, as is found 
in the narrations to which we have referred. 
Thus it all fits, for they asked him 
about the way of doing it according to 
the Sharee'ah, something which they could 
not possibly find out except from the 
guidance of the All-Knowing, All-Wise, 
Giver of the Sharee'ah. Similarly, they 
could also ask him about the way of performing 
the Salaah made obligatory by words of 
the Exalted such as "<tt><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3"><b><i><font color="#339933">Establish 
the Salaah (Prayer)</font></i></b></font></tt>"; 
for their knowledge of the literal meaning 
of "Salaah" could not remove their need 
to ask about its manner according to 
the Sharee'ah, and this is crystal clear.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
As for Nashaasheebi's argument referred 
to, it is of no consequence, for it is 
well-known among the Muslims that the 
Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
is the expounder of the words of the 
Lord of the Worlds, as He says:</font>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<tt><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3" color="#339933"><b><i>And 
We have sent down to you the Message 
that you may explain clearly to the people 
what is sent for them</i></b></font></tt>" 
(Nahl 16:44). Hence, the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) explained the way 
of doing salaah on him, and it included 
mention of his family, so it is compulsory 
to accept that from him, due to Allaah's 
saying:</font>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><tt><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3"><b><i><font color="#339933">So 
take what the Messenger gives you</font></i></b></font></tt><font color="#339933"><i><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3"> 
</font></b></i></font>(Hashr 59:7), and 
the well-known authentic hadeeth, <b>Verily, 
I have been given the Qur'aan and something 
similar to it.</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn224"><sup>225</sup></a></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
I really wonder what Nashaasheebi and 
those taken in by his pompous words would 
say if someone were to reject the tashahhud 
in prayer altogether, or reject the menstruating 
woman's abstaining from prayer and fasting, 
all with the argument that Allaah the 
Exalted did not mention the tashahhud 
in the Qur'aan; He only mentioned bowing 
and prostration, and He did not exempt 
a menstruating woman from prayer and 
fasting in the Qur'aan!! So, do they 
agree with such arguments, which are 
along the lines of his original one, 
or not? If they do, and we hope not, 
then they have strayed far, far away 
from guidance, and have left the mainstream 
of the Muslims; if they do not, then 
they are correct in agreeing with us, 
and their reasons for rejecting those 
arguments are exactly the same as our 
reasons for rejecting Nashaasheebi's 
original pronouncement, which we have 
explained clearly.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Therefore beware, O Muslims, of attempting 
to understand the Qur'aan without recourse 
to the Sunnah, for you will never be 
able to do that, even if you were the 
Seebawaih<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn225"><sup>226</sup></a> 
of the age, the expert of the age in 
the 'Arabic language. Here is an example 
in front of you, for this Nashaasheebi 
is one of the leading scholars of the 
'Arabic language of this period; you 
have seen how he has strayed, after being 
deceived by his knowledge of the language, 
by not seeking the aid of the Sunnah 
in understanding the Qur'aan; in fact 
he has rejected this aid, as you know. 
There are many other examples of this 
- there is not enough room here to mention 
them, but what we have mentioned will 
suffice, and Allaah is the Granter of 
all capability.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
3) The reader will also see that in none 
of these types of salaah on the Prophet 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) is there 
the word sayyid (chief, leader). The 
later scholars have differed about the 
validity of its inclusion in the Ibraaheemee 
salaah. Due to lack of space we will 
not go into the details of that nor make 
mention of those who rejected its validity 
in keeping with the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam)'s complete teaching 
to his ummah when he instructed, "Say: 
O Allaah! send prayers on Muhammad ..." 
on being asked about the manner of salaah 
on him, but we will quote the Haafidh 
Ibn Hajr al-'Asqalaani on this, bearing 
in mind his position as one of the great 
Shaafi'i scholars of both hadeeth and 
fiqh, for contradiction of this teaching 
of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam) has become widespread among Shaafi'i 
scholars!</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Haafiz Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad 
al-Ghuraabeeli (790- 835 AH), a companion 
of Ibn Hajr, said, and I quote from his 
manuscript<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn226"><sup>227</sup></a>: 
</font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
(i.e. Ibn Hajr), may Allaah benefit us 
with his life, was asked about the features 
of salaah on the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam), whether during prayer 
or outside it, compulsory or recommended: 
Is one of its conditions that the Prophet 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) be attributed 
with sayaadah (leadership), e.g. 'O Allaah! 
send prayers on sayyidinaa (our leader) 
Muhammad ...' or 'the foremost of creation', 
or 'the leader of the children of Aadam' 
etc.? Or should one stick to 'O Allaah! 
send prayers on Muhammad'? Which of these 
two is the better approach: including 
the word sayyid, due to it being an established 
attribute of the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam), or leaving it out 
due to the absence of it in the narrations? 
He (Ibn Hajr), may Allaah be pleased 
with him, replied: "Yes, to follow the 
narrated wording is superior. It cannot 
be said, "Maybe the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) himself did not say 
it out of modesty, just as he did not 
say (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) on 
mention of his name, although his ummah 
has been encouraged to do so" - for we 
say that if that were superior, it would 
have been quoted from the Companions 
and then from the Successors, but we 
do not come across it in any narrations 
from any Companion or Successor. This 
is despite the volume of quotations from 
them. We have Imaam Shaafi'i, may Allaah 
exalt his rank, one of the foremost among 
men in his respect for the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam), saying in the preface 
to his book which is a base for the people 
of his madhhab: "O Allaah! send prayers 
on Muhammad ..." etc. until the end of 
what his judgment dictated, "... every 
time one of the rememberers remembers 
him, and every time one of the heedless 
fails to remember him", which he seems 
to have deduced from the authentic hadeeth 
which has in it that the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) saw the Mother of 
the Believers engaging in long and numerous 
glorifications, so he said to her, "You 
have said words which, if weighed against 
the following, would be balanced: Glorified 
be Allaah, as many times as the number 
of His creation"; he (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam) used to like supplications 
which were concise, but exhaustive in 
meaning. Qaadi 'Iyaad set out a chapter 
about salaah on the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) in his book ash- Shifaa' 
(The Book of Cure), quoting in it narrations 
from the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam) on the authority of several 
Companions and Successors; in none of 
these is the word sayyid reported: <br>
a) The hadith of 'Ali, that he used to 
teach them the manner of salaah on the 
Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
by saying, <b>O Allaah, Spreader of Plains, 
Originator of Heights, send the foremost 
of Your prayers, the most fertile of 
Your blessings, and any remaining compliments, 
on Muhammad, Your slave and messenger, 
the opener of what is closed. </b><br>
b) Again from 'Ali, that he used to say, 
"The prayers of Allaah, the Beneficent, 
the Merciful, of the Angels nearest (to 
Allaah), of the Prophets, of the Sincere 
ones, of the Witnesses, of the Righteous, 
and of whatever glorifies You, O Lord 
of the Worlds, be on Muhammad son of 
'Abdullaah, Seal of the Prophets, Imaam 
of the Godfearers, ... etc." <br>
c) On the authority of 'Abdullaah ibn 
Mas'ood, that he used to say, "O Allaah! 
send Your prayers, Your blessings and 
Your mercy, on Muhammad, Your slave and 
messenger, the imaam of goodness, the 
messenger of mercy, ..." etc. <br>
d) From al-Hasan al-Basri, that he used 
to say, "Whoever wants to drink from 
the cup which quenches, from the fount 
of the al-Mustafaa, should say: O Allaah! 
send prayers on Muhammad, and on his 
family, his Companions, his wives, his 
children, his descendants, his household, 
his in-laws, his helpers, his followers, 
and all those who love him." This is 
what he (Qaadi 'Iyaad) has written in 
ash- Shifaa', regarding the manner of 
salaah on the Prophet, on the authority 
of the Companions and those who succeeded 
them, and he also mentioned other things 
in it. Yes, it is related in a hadeeth 
of Ibn Mas'ood that in his salaah on 
the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam), 
he would say, "O Allaah! send the best 
of Your prayers, mercy and blessings 
on the leader (sayyid) of the messengers 
..." etc., transmitted by Ibn Maajah, 
but its isnaad is weak, so the hadeeth 
of 'Ali, transmitted by Tabaraani with 
a acceptable isnaad, takes precedence. 
This hadeeth has difficult words, which 
I have reported and explained in the 
book Fadl an-Nabi (Excellence of the 
Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)") 
by Abul Hasan ibn al-Faaris. Some Shaafi'is 
have said that if a man took an oath 
to send the best salaah on the Prophet 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam), the 
way to fulfil his oath would be to say, 
"O Allaah! send prayers on Muhammad every 
time the rememberers remember him or 
the heedless fail to remember him"; Nawawi 
said, "The one which is most fitting 
to be designated as correct is that one 
should say: O Allaah! send prayers on 
Muhammad, and on the family of Muhammad, 
as you sent prayers on Ibraaheem ..." 
Several of the later scholars have replied 
to this by saying that in neither of 
the two ways mentioned above is there 
anything to prove which is superior as 
regards narration, but as regards the 
meaning, then the former is clearly superior. 
This issue is well-known in the books 
of fiqh, and of all the scholars of fiqh 
who addressed this issue, without exception, 
in none of their words does the word 
sayyid appear. Had this additional word 
been commendable, it would not have escaped 
all of them, leaving them ignorant of 
it. All good is in following what is 
narrated, and Allaah knows best."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ibn 
Hajr's view of the unacceptability of describing 
the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
as sayyid during the salaah on him in accordance 
with the Qur'aanic order, is also that 
of the Hanafi scholars. It is the view 
which must be adhered to, for it is a true 
indication of love for him, (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam); </font> 
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<tt><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="3"><b><i><font color="#339933">Say:

Allaah will love you</font></i></b></font>.</tt>" 
(aal-'Imraan 3:31)</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Because of this, Imaam Nawawi said in 
Rawdah at-Taalibeen (1/265), "The most 
complete salaah on the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) is: O Allaah! send 
your prayers on Muhammad ..." etc., corresponding 
to type no. 3 given, in which there is 
no mention of sayyid!</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
4) It should be known that types nos. 
1 and 4 are the ones which the Messenger 
of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
taught his Companions when they asked 
about the manner of salaah on him, so 
this has been used as evidence that these 
are the best ways of doing the salaah 
on him, for he would not choose anything 
for them or himself except the best and 
noblest. Imaam Nawawi, as mentioned, 
endorsed (in Rawdah at- Taalibeen) that 
if a man were to take an oath to do the 
best possible salaah on the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam), this could not be 
fulfilled except in these ways.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Subki has given another reason: whoever 
does salaah with those types has made 
salaah on the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam) with certainty, and whoever 
does so with other words is in doubt 
whether or not he has performed the prayers 
as requested. This is because they said, 
"How do we send prayers on you?" and 
he replied, "Say: ...", thus defining 
their salaah on him as their saying such-and-such. 
This was mentioned by Haitami in ad-Darr 
al-Mandood (25/2); he then said (27/1) 
that the objective is achieved with all 
the types which have occurred in authentic 
ahaadeeth.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
5) It should be known that it is not 
valid to combine all these way into one 
way of salaah, and the same goes for 
the different tashahhuds given previously. 
In fact, that would be an innovation 
in the religion; the Sunnah is to say 
different ones at different times, as 
Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah has explained 
in his discussion of the takbeers of 
the two 'Eids (Majmoo' al-Fataawaa 29/253/1).</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
6) 'Allaamah Siddeeq Hasan Khaan says 
in his book Nuzul al- Abraar bil 'Ilm 
al-Ma'thoor min al-Ad'iyah wal-Adhkaar, 
after giving many ahaadeeth about the 
excellence of repeated salaah on the 
Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
(p. 161):</font>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There 
is no doubt that the foremost among the 
Muslims in sending salaah on him (sall-Allaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) are the People of 
Hadeeth and the narrators of the purified 
Sunnah, for it is one of their duties 
in this noble branch of learning to make 
salaah on him before every hadeeth, and 
so their tongues are always engaged in 
his mention, may Allah grant him mercy 
and peace. There is no book of Sunnah 
or collection of hadeeth, be it a jaami', 
musnad, mu'jam, juz', etc., except that 
it comprises thousands of ahaadeeth; 
even one of the least bulky ones, Suyooti's 
al-Jaami' as-Sagheer, contains ten thousand 
ahaadeeth, and the rest of the collections 
are no different. So this is the Saved 
Sect: the body of the People of Hadeeth, 
who will be the closest among men to 
the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) on the Day of Resurrection, 
and the most likely to be rewarded by 
his intercession (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam), may my mother and father 
be sacrificed for him! This excellence 
of the People of Hadeeth cannot be surpassed 
by anyone unless he does more than what 
they do, something which is well-nigh 
impossible. Therefore, O desirer of good, 
seeker of salvation, no matter what, 
you should either be a muhaddith, or 
be close to the muhadditheen; do not 
be otherwise ... for apart from that 
there is nothing which will benefit you."</font>

I ask Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, to 
make me one of these People of Hadeeth, 
who are the closest among men to the

a testimony to that. May Allaah shower 
His mercy on Imaam Ahmad, who recited:</font>
