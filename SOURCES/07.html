<div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"He 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) used 
to incline his head during prayer and 
fix his sight towards the ground"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn80"><sup>81</sup></a>- 
"while he was in the Ka'bah, his sight 
did not leave the place of his prostration 
until he came out from it"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn81"><sup>82</sup></a>; 
and he said, I<b>t is not fitting that 
there should be anything in the House 
which disturbs the person praying.</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn82"><sup>83</sup></a> 
</font></div>
<p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"He 
used to forbid looking up at the sky"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn83"><sup>84</sup></a>, 
and he emphasised this prohibition so 
much that he said: <b>People must refrain 
from looking up at the sky in prayer, 
or their sight will not return to them 
(and in one narration: or their sight 
will be plucked away).</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn84"><sup>85</sup></a> 
In another hadeeth: <b>So when you pray, 
do not look here and there, for Allaah 
sets His Face for the face of his slave 
in his prayer as long as he does not 
look away</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn85"><sup>86</sup></a>, 
and he also said about looking here and 
there, <b>"it is a snatching away which 
the devil steals from the slave during 
prayer."</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn86"><sup>87</sup></a></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
He (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) also 
said: <b>Allaah does not cease to turn 
to a slave in his prayer as long as he 
is not looking around; when he turns 
his face away, Allaah turns away from 
him</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn87"><sup>88</sup></a>; 
he "forbade three things: pecking like 
a hen, squatting (iq'aa'), like a dog 
and looking around like a fox"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn88"><sup>89</sup></a>; 
he also used to say, <b>Pray a farewell 
prayer as if you see Him, but if you 
do not see Him, surely He sees you</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn89"><sup>90</sup></a>; 
and, <b>Any person who, when an obligatory 
prayer is due, excels in its ablution, 
humility and bowings, will have it as 
a remission for his previous minor sins 
as long as he does not commit a major 
sin, and this (opportunity) is for all 
times.</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn90"><sup>91</sup></a></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Once he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam), 
prayed in a khameesah<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn91"><sup>92</sup></a> 
and (during the prayer) he looked at 
its marks. So when he finished, he said: 
<b>Take this khameesah of mine to Abu 
Jahm and bring me his anbijaaniyyah</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn92"><sup>93</sup></a>,<b> 
for it has diverted my attention from 
the prayer </b>(in one narration: <b>for 
I have looked at its marks during the 
prayer and it almost put me to trial</b>).<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn93"><sup>94</sup></a> 
Also "'Aaishah had a cloth with pictures 
spread towards a sahwah<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn94"><sup>95</sup></a>, 
towards which the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) prayed and then said: 
<b>Take it away from me [for its pictures 
did not cease to thwart me in my prayer].</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn95"><sup>96</sup></a></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
He would also say: <b>Prayer is not valid 
when the food has been served, nor when 
it is time to relieve oneself of the 
two filths.</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/07_fn.html#fn96"><sup>97</sup></a></font>
