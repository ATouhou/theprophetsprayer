2) Abu Salamah asked `A'ishah about the 
prayer of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
`alaihi wa sallam). She said, <b>"He 
performed thirteen rak`ahs </b>(in the 
night prayer)<b>: he observed eight rak`ahs 
and would then observe Witr and then 
observe two rak`ahs sittin<u>g</u>, and 
when he wanted to bow, he stood up and 
then bowed down, and then observed two 
rak`ahs in between the adhaan and iqaamah 
of the Dawn Prayer."</b><br>

3) Thawbaan said, "We were on a journey 
with the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
`alaihi wa sallam), when he said, <b>Truly, 
this journey is an exertion and a burden, 
so when each of you has prayed Witr, 
he should perform two rak`ahs; if he 
wakes up (then well and good), otherwise 
these two will be (the night prayer) 
for him.</b><br>
Related by Daarimi (1/374), Ibn Khuzaimah 
in his Saheeh (2/159/1103) &amp; Ibn 
Hibbaan (683) from various routes going 
back to: Ibn Wahb, who said: Mu`aawiyah 
ibn Saalih narrated to me from Shuraih 
ibn `Ubaid from `Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Jubair 
ibn Nufair from his father from Thawbaan, 
who said ...</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Ibn Wahb has been backed up by `Abdullaah 
ibn Saalih, who said: Mu`aawiyah ibn 
Saalih narrated to us ... etc., related 
by Daaraqutni (p. 177) &amp; Tabaraani 
in al-Mu`jam al-Kabeer (1410). `Abdullaah 
ibn Saalih is a shaykh of Bukhaari, so 
he can be used as evidence in supporting 
others' narrations.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
This hadeeth is used as evidence by Imaam 
Ibn Khuzaimah, "that prayer after Witr 
is allowed to whoever wants to pray after 
it, and that the two rak`ahs which the 
Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) 
used to pray after Witr were not exclusively 
for him over his Ummah, for he has ordered 
us to pray two rak`ahs after Witr, an 
order of recommendation and preference, 
not one of obligation and compulsion."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Hence, it is clear to us from this hadeeth 
(because of his general order to his 
Ummah) that the two rak`ahs after Witr 
were not exclusively for him; it seems 
that the purpose of his command to make 
the last prayer at night odd was to prevent 
neglect of the one odd rak`ah, so this 
objective is not contradicted by the 
two rak`ahs after it, as established 
in his practice and his command. Allaah 
knows best.</font>
