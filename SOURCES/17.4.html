<li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Abu 
Daawood</b> said, "I heard <b>Ahmad 
ibn Hanbal</b> declaring `Abd ar-Rahmaan 
ibn Ishaaq al-Koofi da`eef (weak)." 
[This is why Imaam Ahmad did not accept 
this hadeeth of his, for his son `Abdullaah 
said, "I saw that when praying, my 
father placed his hands, one on the 
other, above the navel."] </font>
<li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nawawi 
</b>said in Majmoo` (3/313), and also 
in Sharh Saheeh Muslim and elsewhere, 
"They (the scholars of hadeeth) agree 
in declaring this hadeeth weak, because 
it is a narration of `Abd ar-Rahmaan 
ibn Ishaaq al-Waasiti, who is a da`eef 
(weak) narrator, as agreed upon by 
the Imaams of Jarh and Ta`deel (Authentication 
and Disparagement of reporters)." </font>
<li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Zayla`i 
</b>said in Nasb ar-Raayah (1/314), 
<b>"Baihaqi </b>said in al-Ma`rifah: 
`Its isnaad is not firm, for it is 
a unique narration of `Abd ar-Rahmaan 
ibn Ishaaq al-Waasiti, who is matrook 
(abandoned)'." </font>
<li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ibn 
Hajar</b> said in Fath al-Baari (2/186), 
"It is a weak hadeeth."</font>
</ol>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
further points to its weakness is that 
contrary to it has been narrated on the 
authority of `Ali with a better isnaad: 
the hadeeth of Ibn Jareer al-Dabbi <tt>`an</tt> 
his father, who said, "I saw `Ali (radi 
Allaahu `anhu) holding his left arm with 
his right on the wrist, <b>above the navel"</b> 
- this isnaad is a candidate for the rank 
of <tt>hasan</tt>; Baihaqi (1/301) firmly 
designated it to be hasan, and Bukhaari 
(1/301) designated it with certainty while 
giving it in an abridged, ta`leeq form. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
What is authentic from the Prophet (sallallaahu 
`alaihi wa sallam) with respect to the 
position of the hands is that they should 
be on the chest; there are many ahaadeeth 
about this, among them is one on the 
authority of Taawoos, who said, "The 
Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam) used to place his right arm 
on his left arm, and clasp them firmly 
on his chest during prayer" - transmitted 
by Abu Daawood (759) with a saheeh isnaad. 
Although this is mursal, it is enough 
as proof for all scholars, with all their 
various opinions regarding the Mursal 
Hadeeth, since it is saheeh as a mursal 
isnaad and has also been related as mawsool 
in many narrations; hence, it is valid 
as proof for all. Some of the supporting 
narrations are as follows: </font>
<ol>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
from Waa'il ibn Hujr: "That he saw 
the Prophet - sallallaahu `alaihi wa 
sallam - put his right hand upon his 
left and place them upon his chest." 
Reported by Ibn Khuzaimah in his Saheeh 
(Nasb ar-Raayah, 1/314) and reported 
by Baihaqi in his Sunan (2/30) with 
two chains of narration which support 
each other. </font>
<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
from Qabeesah ibn Hulb, from his father 
who said:<br>
"I saw the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam), leave [after completing 
the Prayer] from his right and his 
left, and I saw him place this upon 
his chest - Yahyaa (Ibn Sa'eed) described 
the right (hand) upon the left above 
the joint."<br>
Reported by Ahmad (5/226) with a chain 
of narrators who are of the standard 
set by Muslim except for Qabeesah, 
but he is declared reliable by 'Ijli 
&amp; Ibn Hibbaan; however, no one 
narrates from him except Simaak ibn 
Harb about whom Ibn al-Madeeni and 
Nasaa'i say: "Unknown" and Ibn Hajar 
says in Taqreeb: "He is `Maqbool' [i.e. 
acceptable only if supported]." The 
hadeeth of one such as him are hasan 
as supporting narrations, and therefore 
Tirmidhi said after quoting the part 
of this hadeeth concerning taking the 
left hand with the right, "It is a 
hasan hadeeth."</font>
</ol>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
these are three ahaadeeth which show that 
the Sunnah is to place the hands on the 
chest, and one who comes across them will 
not doubt that together they are sufficient 
to prove this. </font>
