Ibn Taahir quoted it in Tadhkirah al-Mawdoo`aat 
(p.93), and said, "The isnaad contains 
Ma'moon ibn Ahmad al-Harawi, an utter liar 
who used to narrate fabrications." More 
of his description is given in hadeeth 
2 below. Ibn Hibbaan mentioned this hadeeth 
under his name in ad-Du`afaa (The Weak 
Narrators) and Dhahabi regarded it as one 
of his calamities! </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond"> 
Some Hanafis have been deceived by this 
hadeeth, arguing on its basis that any 
recitation behind the imaam is totally 
haraam! Abul Hasanaat al-Luknawi said 
in at-Ta`leeq al-Mumajjid `alaa Muwatta` 
Muhammad (p. 99), "It was mentioned by 
the author of Nihaayah and by others 
as marfoo` with the wording, `_there 
is a burning coal in his mouth', and 
it is totally baseless."</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond"> 
He had said before that, "In no saheeh 
marfoo` hadeeth is there a forbiddance 
of reciting al-Faatihah behind the imaam; 
all that they quote as marfoo` regarding 
this is either baseless or not authentic", 
and had then mentioned this hadeeth with 
both wordings as an example.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond"> 
The people of knowledge, both past and 
present, have differed regarding recitation 
behind the imaam, taking one of three 
views: </font>
<ol>
<li><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond"> 
That recitation in loud and quiet prayers 
is obligatory. </font>
<li><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond"> 
That silence in loud and quiet prayers 
is obligatory. </font>
<li><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond"> 
That there be recitation in quiet, 
but not in loud, prayers.</font>
</ol>
<font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond">This 
last view is the most balanced and closest 
to the truth, for in it, all the evidences 
can be accommodated such that none of them 
is rejected totally. It is the view of 
Maalik and Ahmad, and has also been prefered 
after analysis by some Hanafis, including 
Abul Hasanaat al-Luknawi in his aforementioned 
book. </font>

Ibn Taahir quoted it in Tadhkirah al-Mawdoo`aat 
(p. 87), and said, "The isnaad contains 
Ma'moon ibn Ahmad al-Harawi, an utter liar 
who used to fabricate ahadeeth." </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> 
Dhahabi said about him, "He brought calamities 
and disgraceful reports. He invented 
ahaadeeth, this being one of them, and 
related them apparently on the authority 
of reliable narrators."</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> 
It is clear to me from the ahaadeeth 
which Ma'moon al-Harawi has invented 
that he is a bigoted zealot of the Hanafi 
Madhhab, for all the ahaadeeth mentioned 
under his descriptions (in books of narrators) 
revolve around supporting Imaam Abu Haneefah 
and insulting Imaam Shaafi`i; amongst 
them is this one: a clear insult to the 
Shaafi`i view, which approves the raising 
of the hands on going down into rukoo` 
and rising from it (which is the truth 
without doubt), while obviously backing 
the Hanafi view which says that this 
is makrooh. This disgusting man was not 
even satisfied with the position of his 
Madhhab that raising the hands was makrooh: 
he even went to the extent of inventing 
this hadeeth, in order to propagate amongst 
the people that raising the hands actually 
invalidates the prayer!</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> 
Perhaps he also intended to support Makhool's 
narration from Abu Haneefah that he said, 
"He who raises his hands during prayer, 
his prayer is ruined", a narration which 
deceived Ameer Kaatib al-Itqaani, who 
compiled a treatise on the basis of it 
to argue the invalidation of the prayer 
by the raising of the hands! Similarly 
deceived was the one who trod his path 
and ruled that it was not permissible 
for Hanafis to pray behind Shaafi`is 
because the latter raise their hands! 
While all along, this narration from 
Abu Haneefah is utterly false, as `Allaamah 
Abul Hasanaat al-Luknawi has verified 
in al-Fawa`id al-Bahiyyah fi Taraajum 
al-Hanafeeyyah (pp. 116, 216-7).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> 
Shaikh `Ali al-Qaari quoted this hadeeth 
in al-Mawdoo`at and then said (p. 81), 
"This hadeeth was fabricated by Muhammad 
b. `Ukaashah al-Kirmaani, may Allaah 
disgrace him." Later (p. 129), he quoted 
Ibn al-Qayyim as saying, "It is fabricated."</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> 
This is contrary to what has been established 
(above) that the fabricator was al-Harawi; 
if it is proved, than perhaps one of 
them stole it from the other!</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> 
We can see from all this what lack of 
heed to the Sunnah, and abandonment of 
verification of narrations from the Prophet 
(sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) and the 
Imaams, can do!</font>
<p> <font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> 
About raising the hands on going into 
rukoo` and rising from it, many many 
ahadeeth have been narrated from the 
Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam): 
they are actually mutawaatir in the eyes 
of the scholars; in fact, raising the 
hands with every takbeer is proven on 
his authority in many ahadeeth; whereas 
not raising the hands is not authentically-related 
from him except once via `Abdullaah ibn 
Mas`ood (radi Allaahu `anhu), but this 
is not suitable for putting into practice, 
for it is naaf (negatory). It is firmly 
established, in the eyes of the Hanafis 
and others, that the muthbit (affirmatory) 
takes precedence over the naaf (negatory); 
this is even when the affirmatory is 
on its own, let alone the case when it 
is a multitude of narrations, as in this 
issue! On the basis of this principle, 
and in the abscence of anything contrary, 
this renders it binding on them to adopt 
the raising of the hands, and not to 
stick zealously to the Madhhab after 
the establishment of proof. However, 
it is a pity that only a handful of the 
earlier or later ones have adopted it, 
so much so that not raising the hands 
has become a landmark for them!</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> 
Yet another of the inventions of this 
vile liar, this time a personal insult 
to Imaam Shaafi`i (Muhammad bin Idrees), 
is the following:</font>

<b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mawdoo` 
(Fabricated).</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Ibn al-Jawzi quoted it in al-Mawdoo`aat(1/457) 
via: </font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Ma'moon ibn Ahmad as-Salmi, who said: 
Ahmad ibn `Abdullaah al-Juwaibaari narrated 
to us: `Abdullaah ibn Mi`daan al-Azadi 
informed us from Anas, as marfoo`;</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
and then said, "Fabricated; invented 
by Ma'moon or by Juwaibaari. Haakim mentioned 
in Madhkal that it was said to Ma'moon, 
`Do you not look to Shaafi`i and his 
followers?' So he said, `Ahmad ibn `Abdullaah 
al-Juwaibaari narrated to us ...' etc., 
so it becomes evident from this that 
he is the fabricator of it."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
The following addition appears in Lisaan: 
"Haakim then said, `Anyone whom Allaah 
has granted the least amount of intelligence 
would testify that a hadeeth such as 
this is a fabrication attributed to the 
Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam)'."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
The hadeeth does have other routes of 
narration, but these depend on liars 
and unknown reporters. Therefore, it 
is extremely bizarre that `Allaamah `Ayni 
should incline towards strengthening 
the hadeeth with those other routes, 
and that Shaykh Kawthari should support 
him! However, it is no surprise from 
the latter, for he was notorious for 
being submerged in zealousy for Imaam 
Abu Haneefah (rahimahullaah), even if 
it entailed insulting other Imaams; but 
it is very surprising from `Ayni, for 
he was generally known not to go to such 
extremes. The opinion of these two has 
been refuted, with analysis of the other 
routes of narration referred to, in a 
unique way in `Allaamah Yamaanee's valuable 
book, at-Tankeel bi maa fi Ta'neeb al-Kawthari 
min al-Abaateel (1/20, 446-9).</font>
