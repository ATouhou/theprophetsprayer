Further, the meaning of this hadeeth

from Abu Sufyaan from Jaabir from the 
Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam).</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Ibn `Abdul-Barr said, "Proof cannot be 
established with this isnaad because 
al-Haarith ibn Ghisseen is majhool (unknown)"; 
Ibn Hazm said, "This is a fallen narration. 
Abu Sufyaan is weak; al-Haarith ibn Ghisseen

<p> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
To judge this hadeeth on Sallaam ibn 
Sulaim - also known as Sallaam ibn Sulaimaan 
- is better, for he is agreed to be da`eef; 
in fact, Ibn Khiraash said about him, 
"An utter liar" and Ibn Hibbaan said, 
"He narrated fabricated ahaadeeth."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
As for Abu Sufyaan, he is not weak as 
Ibn Hazm said, but rather he is reliable 
as Ibn Hajar has said in at-Taqreeb, 
and Muslim narrates from him in his Saheeh. 
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Al-Haarith ibn Ghisseen is unknown as 
Ibn Hazm said, as did Ibn `Abdul Barr, 
even though Ibn Hibbaan does mention 
him in ath-Thiqaat (The Reliable Narrators) 
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

As for the saying of Sha`raani in al-Meezaan 
[1/28], "This hadeeth, although debatable 
in the eyes of the muhadditheen, is nevertheless 
authentic in the eyes of the people of 
Kashf", it is completely false and whimsical, 
and is not to be given any significance! 
This is because authenticating ahaadeeth 
by way of Kashf ("unveiling", while in 
a state of trance) is a wicked innovation 
of the Sufis, and depending upon it leads 
to the authentication of false, baseless 
ahaadeeth such as this one. This is because, 
even at the best of times, Kashf is like 
opinion, which is sometimes correct and 
sometimes wrong - and that is if no personal 
desires enter into it! We ask Allaah 
to save us from it and from everything 
He is not pleased with.</font>

"Its isnaad is da`eef."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
The isnaad is actually very weak due 
to what we have mentioned about Juwaibir,

meaning, however, the hadeeth is fabricated,

what will follow.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Suyooti quoted the hadeeth in its entirety 
at the begining of his treatise Jazeel 
al-Mawaahib fi Ikhtilaaf al-Madhaahib 
from the narration of Bayhaqi in al-Madkhal, 
and Dailami related it from this route, 
as occurs in al-Mawdoo`aat of `Ali al-Qaari 
[p.19]. Once you know this, then the 
saying of Suyooti in his aforementioned 
treatise is very strange: "... and this 
hadeeth contains several points to note; 
among them his (sallallaahu `alaihi wa 
sallam) informing of the disagreements 
between the madhaahib in non-fundamental 
matters, and that is one of his miracles, 
since it is information about the Unseen; 
also, his being pleased with that and 
approving of it, since he described it 
as a mercy, and that the burdened person 
may choose whichever of them he wishes."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
It could be said to him: first establish 
the throne, and then sit. What he has 
mentioned about the choice is false: 
it is not possible for the Muslim to 
cling to it and act upon its generality, 
since it leads to breaking away from 
the restrictions of the Sharee`ah, as 
is not hard to see. See also the discussion

Ibn Hazm said in al-Ihkaam (6/83), after 
declaring that this hadeeth (no. 2, with 
all its versions) is undoubtedly a lie 
since it also contradicts many aayaat 
of the Qur'aan, e.g. Najm (53:3-4), Nisaa' 
(4:82), Anfaal (8:46), the following:</font>
<p> 
<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"... 
therefore, it is absurd that the Messenger 
(sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) would 
command us to follow every view expressed 
by the Companions, may Allaah be pleased 
with them all, for there were among them 
those who permitted something while others 
prohibited it: if the above were the 
case, trading in intoxicants would be 
permissible if one followed Samurah ibn 
Jundub; it would be permissible for someone 
fasting to eat snow if one followed Abu 
Talhah, but prohibited by following others 
beside him; to not take a bath due to 
incomplete intercourse would be obligatory 
if one followed `Ali, `Uthmaan, Talhah, 
Abu Ayyoob and Ubayy ibn Ka`b, but prohibited 
if one followed `Aa'ishah and Ibn `Umar; 
all these examples have been related 
to us with authentic chains of narration."</font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
He then went on to explain at length 
some opinions expressed by Companions 
in which they were wrong about the Sunnah, 
both during the lifetime of the Prophet 
(sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) and after 
his death. He then said (6/86), </font>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"So 
how can it be allowable to blindly follow 
the opinions of people who make mistakes 
as well as get it right?!"</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Before that, he had explained, under 
the heading Differing Condemned (5/64), 
the error of those who say, "Disagreement 
is a mercy", using as evidence the hadeeth, 
<b>"My Companions are like the stars: 
whichever of them you follow, you will 
be rightly-guided"</b>, by clarifying 
that the hadeeth is a lie for several 
reasons:</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
(i) it is not authentic with regard to 
its chain of narration;</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
(ii) further, the Prophet (sallallaahu 
`alaihi wa sallam) could not have commanded 
us to follow something which he himself 
had declared erroneous at times; e.g. 
he pointed out Abu Bakr's mistake in 
interpreting a dream, `Umar's error in 
another interpretation, and Abus-Sanaabil's 
going wrong in a verdict he gave; hence, 
it is not possible for him to order us 
to follow someone mistaken;</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
(iii) the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam) never spoke falsehood; his 
words were always truth: the comparison 
with the stars is clearly flawed, since 
for example, if someone intends to travel 
a certain route directed by the stars 
in the constellation of Capricorn, but 
instead follows the stars in Cancer, 
he will not be correctly-guided, but 
will stray far away from the correct 
path and err tremendously; therefore, 
it is obviously false to say that following 
any star will guide one correctly.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Ibn al-Mulaqqin gave a summarised version 
of Ibn Hazm's words in his al-Khulaasah 
[2/175], endorsed it and ended his discussion 
of the hadeeth saying: Ibn Hazm said,"This 
is an invented, fabricated, false narration, 
not correct at all."</font>
