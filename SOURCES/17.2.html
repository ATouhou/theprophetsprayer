Narrated Ibn `Abbaas (Allaah be pleased 
with him): </font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
man came to Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu 
`alaihi wa sallam) and said, "I saw in 
a dream, a cloud having shade. Butter 
and honey were dropping from it and I 
saw the people gathering it in their 
hands, some gathering much and some little. 
And behold, there was a rope extending 
from the earth to the sky, and I saw 
that you held it and went up; then, another 
man held it and went up and (after that) 
another (third) man held it and went 
up, and then another (fourth) man held 
it, but it broke and then got connected 
again." Abu Bakr said, "O Allaah's Messenger! 
Let my father be sacrificed for you! 
By Allaah, allow me to interpret this 
dream." The Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam) said to him, <b>Interpret 
it.</b> Abu Bakr said, "The cloud with 
shade symbolises Islaam, and the butter 
and the honey dropping from it symbolises 
the Qur'aan, it's sweetness and some 
people learning much of the Qur'aan while 
some a little. The rope which is extended 
from the sky to the earth is the Truth 
which you (the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam) are following. You follow 
it and Allaah will raise you high with 
it, and then another person will follow 
it and will rise up with it and then 
another man will follow it but it will 
break and then it will be connected for 
him and he will rise up with it. O Allaah's 
Messenger! Let my father be sacrificed 
for you! Am I right or wrong?" The Prophet 
(sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) replied, 
<b>You are right in some of it and wrong 
in some of it.</b> Abu Bakr said, "O 
Allaah's Prophet! By Allaah, you must 
tell me in what I was wrong." The Prophet 
(sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said, 
<b>Do not swear.</b></font></blockquote>
