<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
Hadeeth and Fiqh literature, this term 
refers to the Companion mentioned in 
the following hadeeth of Saheeh al-Bukhaari 
(Book of Prayer, English translation 
by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan); many other 
narrations of this incident are found 
in the various collections of hadeeth, 
and provide an important source of instructions 
from the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam) regarding the correct way 
to pray:</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Narrated Abu Hurairah (radi Allaahu `anhu): 
</font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam) entered the mosque and a person 
followed him. The man prayed and then 
went to the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam) and greeted him; he returned 
the greeting and said (to him), <b>Go 
back and pray, for you have not prayed.</b> 
The man went back and prayed in the same 
way as before, and then returned and 
greeted the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi 
wa sallam), who said, <b>Go back and 
pray, for you have not prayed, </b>three 
times. The man said, "By Him Who sent 
you with the Truth, I cannot do so any 
better than this, so please teach me." 
He said,<b> When you stand for the Prayer, 
say takbeer and then recite what is easy 
for you from the Qur'aan (from what you 
know by heart); then bow until you feel 
at ease in rukoo`; then raise your head 
and stand up straight, then prostrate 
until you feel at ease in sajdah; then 
sit with calmness until you feel at ease, 
and do likewise in all your prayers.</b></font></blockquote>

Daawood, etc. contain further details.]
