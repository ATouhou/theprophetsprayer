<div align="left">When the Messenger 
of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam) stood for prayer, 
he would face the Ka'bah in 
both obligatory and voluntary 
prayers<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn00"><sup><font size=-2>1</font></sup></a>, 
and he (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam) ordered that, saying 
to the "one who prayed badly"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn01"><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup></a> 
: When you stand for prayer, 
perform ablution prefectly, 
then face the qiblah and say 
takbeer.<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn02"><sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup></a> 
</div>
<p align="left"> "During a journey, 
he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam) would pray voluntary 
prayers and witr on his mount, 
wherever it faced carrying 
him [east or west]."<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn03"><sup><font size=-2>4</font></sup></a>
<p align="left"> The saying of 
Allaah, the Exalted, <tt>"Wherever 
you turn, there is the Face 
of Allaah"</tt> (Baqarah, 2:115) 
applies to this.<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn04"><sup><font size=-2>5</font></sup></a>
<p align="left"> "[Sometimes] 
when he intended to pray non-obligatory 
prayers on his she-camel, he 
would make it face the qiblah, 
say takbeer, and pray towards 
wherever his mount turned its 
face."<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn05"><sup><font size=-2>6</font></sup></a>
<p align="left"> "He would make 
rukoo' and sajdah on his mount 
by lowering his head, making 
the sajdah lower than the rukoo'."<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn06"><sup><font size=-2>7</font></sup></a>
<p align="left"> "When he intended 
to pray obligatory prayers, 
he would dismount and face 
the qiblah."<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn07"><sup><font size=-2>8</font></sup></a>
<p align="left"> In prayer during 
severe fear, he (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) set the 
example for his ummah to pray 
"on foot, standing on their 
feet, or mounted; facing the 
qiblah or not facing it"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn08"><sup><font size=-2>9</font></sup></a>, 
and he also said, <b>When they 
(the armies) meet, then it 
(i.e. the prayer) is takbeer 
and indication with the head.</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn09"><sup><font size=-2>10</font></sup></a>
<p align="left"> He (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) also used 
to say: <b>What is between 
the east and the west is qiblah.</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn10"><sup><font size=-2>11</font></sup></a>
<p align="left"> Jaabir (radiallaahu 
'anhu) said:
<p align="left"> "Once, when 
we were with the Messenger 
of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam) on an expedition, 
the sky was cloudy, so we tried 
to find the Qibla but we differed, 
so each one of us prayed in 
a different direction, and 
each of us drew marks in front 
of him in order to mark our 
positions. In the morning, 
we looked at it and found that 
we had not prayed towards the 
Qiblah. So we mentioned this 
to the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) [but he 
did not order us to repeat 
(the prayer)] and he said: 
<b>Your prayer was sufficient.</b>"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn11"><sup><font size=-2>12</font></sup></a>
<p align="left"> "He (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) used to 
pray towards Bait al-Muqaddas 
[with the Ka'bah in front of 
him] before the following verse 
was revealed: "<tt>We see the 
turning of your faces to the 
heavens; now shall we turn 
you to a Qiblah that shall 
please you: turn then your 
faces in the direction of the 
Sacred Mosque"</tt> (Baqarah 
2:144). When it was revealed 
he faced the Ka'bah. There 
were people at Qubaa' praying 
Fajr when someone came to them 
and said, 'Verily the Messenger 
of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam) has had some of 
the Qur'aan revealed to him 
last night and he has been 
ordered to face the Ka'bah, 
[verily] so face it'. Their 
faces were towards Shaam, so 
they turned round [and their 
Imaam turned round to face 
the qiblah along with them]."<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/03_fn.html#fn12"><sup><font size=-2>13</font></sup></a>
