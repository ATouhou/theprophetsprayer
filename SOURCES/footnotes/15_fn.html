      <a name="fn276"><font size=+1><b>277</b></font></a>Abu Daawood, Nasaa'i &amp; Tirmidhi, who declared it
      saheeh.<p>
      <a name="fn277"><font size=+1><b>278</b></font>Abu Daawood &amp; Ibn Khuzaimah (1/87/2) with a saheeh sanad.
      `Abdul Haqq also declared it saheeh in his <tt>Ahkaam</tt> (56/2), as did
      Nawawi &amp; Ibn Hajar. It was also transmitted via another route by `Abdur
      Razzaaq in his Musannaf (2/219), Abu Ya`laa in his Musnad (3/1253), Tabaraani
      in <tt>Mu`jam al-Kabeer</tt> (3/67/2) and <tt>Mu`jam al-Awsat</tt> (no. 4476 -
      my numbering) &amp; Daaraqutni .<p>
      <a name="fn278"><font size=+1><b>279</b></font></a>Nasaa'i, Ahmad &amp; Siraaj with a saheeh sanad.<p>
      <a name="fn279"><font size=+1><b>280</b></font></a>Ibn Khuzaimah, Baihaqi, Diyaa' in
      <tt>al-Mukhtaarah</tt> &amp; `Abdul Ghani al-Maqdisi in  his Sunan (243/1) with
      a saheeh isnaad; Ahmad, Tabaraani in <tt>Mu`jam al-Awsat</tt>  (32/2), Baihaqi,
      Ibn al-Mulaqqin (29/1) and Haakim, who declared it saheeh and Dhahabi agreed.
      Its takhreej is given in <tt>Irwaa' al-Ghaleel</tt> under hadeeth no. 327.<p>
      <a name="fn280"><font size=+1><b>281</b></font></a>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah, Siraaj, Ibn Khuzaimah &amp;
      Tabaraani.<p>
      <p>
      <b>*NB:  </b>The Ibaadiyyah have distorted this hadeeth:  their scholar Rabee`
      has related it in his unreliable Musnad with a different wording to justify
      their view that raising the hands with takbeer invalidates the Prayer!  That
      wording is false, as I have explained in <tt>ad-Da`eefah </tt>(6044).<p>
      <a name="fn281"><font size=+1><b>282</b></font></a>Haakim &amp; Dhahabi declared it saheeh; it has
      already been given in full under the opening "Takbeer".<p>
      <a name="fn282"><font size=+1><b>283</b></font></a> The first supplication is the fullest form of the
      du`aa' known as <tt>kaffaarah al-majlis </tt>(expiation of the gathering);
      "<b>he who says it in a gathering of Remembrance (of Allaah), it will be like a
      seal to stamp it with, and he who says it in a gathering of vain talk, it will
      be an expiation for it</b>" - authentically related by Haakim and Tabaraan.
      The second supplication is, of course, from the Sunnah of sending peace and
      mercy on the Messenger.  These two supplications are thus the best way of
      implementing the following Islamic guideline:  "<b>No people sit in a gathering
      in which they do not mention Allaah, nor send prayers on the Prophet, without
      it being a source of regret for them;  if Allaah wishes, He will punish them,
      or if He wishes, he will forgive them</b>" - authentically related by Tirmidhi,
      Haakim &amp; Ahmad.  See Shaykh Albaani's <tt>Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth
      as-Saheehah</tt>  (74-81) for details.
