      <a name="fn169"><font size=+1><b>170</b></font></a>Muslim &amp; Abu `Awaanah.  The pause negated in this
      hadeeth could be a pause for reciting an opening supplication, and not include
      a pause for reciting the <tt>isti`aadhah</tt>, or it could be wider in meaning
      than that;  I find the former possibility more convincing.  There are two views
      among the scholars regarding the isti`aadhah, and we regard the correct one as
      being that it is to be said in every rak`ah;  the details of all this are given
      in <tt>al-Asl</tt>.<p>

      Ibn Haani's <tt>Masaa'il </tt>(1/52).  Jaabir bin `Abdullaah (radi Allaahu
      `anhu) said, "He who prays a rak`ah in which he does not recite the Mother of
      the Qur'aan has not prayed, except behind an imaam" - related by Maalik in
      <tt>Muwatta'</tt>.<p>
