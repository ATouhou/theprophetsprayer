<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="fn13">[14]</a>I 
now say: Muhammad al-Ghazaali's recent 
writings such as his newly-released book 
entitled As-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah bayna 
Ahl al-Hadeeth wa Ahl al-Fiqh (The Prophetic 
Sunnah between the People of Hadeeth 
and the People of Fiqh) have confirmed 
that he himself is one of those inviters 
to Islaam who are "themselves utterly 
confused"! His writings have for long 
betrayed his confusion, his distortion 
of the Sunnah, and his using his intellect 
to authenticate or falsify ahaadeeth, 
not by turning to the principles and 
science of Hadeeth, nor to the experts 
of that field; instead, whatever appeals 
to him, he authenticates, even if it 
is weak, and declares unreliable whatever 
is not to his liking, even if it is agreed 
to be authentic!</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
His above approach is shown most obviously 
in his discussion of the ahaadeeth in 
his previous book Fiqh as- Seerah , where 
he explains his methodology of accepting 
unreliable ahaadeeth and discarding authentic 
ones on the basis of the text of the 
hadeeth alone, from which the reader 
can see that the objective criticism 
of Hadeeth has no value in his eyes if 
it contradicts a "reasoned analysis", 
which varies enormously from person to 
person, for what is truth to one is falsehood 
to another! Thus the whole of Islaam 
becomes subject to personal whims, having 
no principles nor reference points except 
personal opinion; this is poles apart 
from the position of the early leading 
'ulamaa of Islaam, "that the Isnaad is 
part of the religion; were it not for 
the Isnaad, people would have said whatever 
they wished."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
His latest above-mentioned book has exposed 
to the people his Mu'tazilite methodology, 
his blatant disregard for the Imaams 
of Hadeeth and their efforts over the 
ages in serving the Sunnah, and distinguishing 
the genuine traditions from the unreliable 
ones, and his lack of appreciation of 
the efforts of the Imaams of Fiqh in 
their laying down principles and developing 
issues on that basis, for he takes from 
these and leaves from them whatever he 
wishes, with no consistency towards any 
set of principles or fundamentals!</font>
