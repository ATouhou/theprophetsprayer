ibid. Khattaabi said, "The meaning of 
`Imran's hadeeth is intended for a sick 
person who is able to undergo hardship 
and stand with difficulty. Hence the 
reward of praying sitting has been made 
half of the reward of praying standing: 
encouraging him to pray standing while 
allowing him to sit." Ibn Hajr said in 
<tt>Fath al-Baari </tt>(2/468): "This 
deduction is valid".</font>

This is the sunnah about the pulpit: 
that it should have three steps, not 
more, To have more is an innovation, 
from the period of Bani Umayyah, which 
often causes an interruption in the row, 
and to get out of that by having it in 
the western corner of the mosque or in 
the mihrab is another innovation, as 
is the raising of it in the wall like 
a balcony to which one ascends by means 
of steps in the wall! Whereas the best 
guidance is the guidance of Muhammad 
(sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam). See

Bukhaari. The sutrah is a must for the 
Imaam or a person praying alone, even 
in a large mosque. Ibn Haani said in 
his <tt>Masaa'il from Imaam Ahmad</tt> 
(1/66): "Abu `Abdullaah (i.e. Imaam Ahmad 
ibn Hanbal) saw me one day when I was 
praying without a sutrah in front of 
me, and I was in a (large) congregational 
mosque, so he said to me: `Take something 
as a sutrah', so I took a man as a sutrah." 
This contains an indication that Imaam 
Ahmad did not differentiate between big 
or small mosques in taking a sutrah - 
and that is surely correct, but this 
is something neglected by most people, 
including imaams of mosques, in every 
land that I have visited, including Arabia 
which I was able to tour in Rajab of 
this year (1410), so the `ulamaa should 
tell the people and advise them of this, 
explaining its ruling and that it is 
also required in the Two Sacred Mosques.</font>

Ahmad, Daaraqutni &amp; Tabari with a 
saheeh isnaad, and similar in meaning 
to this hadeeth is found in Bukhaari 
and Muslim and others on the authority 
of several Companions. It is one of the 
many ahaadeeth which the Qadiani group 
disbelieve, for they do not believe in 
the world of the jinn which is mentioned 
in the Qur'aan and the Sunnah. Their 
method of discarding the texts is well-known: 
if it is from the Qur'aan, they change 
its meaning e.g. the saying of the Exalted 
<b>"Say, it has been revealed to me that 
a group of jinns listened"</b> (72:1); 
they say "i.e. a group of humans"! making 
the word "jinn" synonymous with "human"! 
Hence they play with the language and 
the religion; if it is from the Sunnah, 
then if it is possible for them to change 
it with a false interpretation they do 
so, otherwise they find it easy to declare 
it to be false, even if all the Imaams 
of Hadeeth and the whole ummah behind 
them are agreed on its authenticity, 
nay its being mutawaatir. May Allaah 
guide them.</font>

i.e. mature, and what is meant by `cut 
off' is `rendered futile'. As regards 
the hadeeth: "Nothing cuts off the prayer", 
then it is a weak hadeeth as I have shown 
in <tt>Tamaam al-Minnah</tt> (p. 306).</font>
