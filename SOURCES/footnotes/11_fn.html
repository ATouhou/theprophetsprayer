      <a name="fn77"><font size=+1><b>78</b></font></a>Bukhaari  &amp; Muslim.<p>
      <a name="fn78"><font size=+1><b>79</b></font>Abu Daawood &amp; Haakim, who declared it <tt>saheeh</tt> and
      Dhahabi  agreed.<p>
      <a name="fn79"><font size=+1><b>80</b></font></a>Abu Ya`laa in his Musnad (284/2) with a good isnaad
      &amp; Ibn Khuzaimah (1/79/2) with a different, <tt>saheeh</tt> isnaad.<p>
      <a name="fn80"><font size=+1><b>81</b></font></a>Nasaa'i, Daaraqutni  &amp; Mukhlis in
      <tt>al-Fawaa'id</tt> (1/2/2) with two <tt>saheeh</tt> isnaads.  This raising of
      the hands has been reported from ten Companions, and a number of the
      <tt>Salaf</tt> viewed it as correct, among them Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Hasan
      Basri, Taawoos, his son `Abdullaah, Naafi` the freed slave of Ibn `Umar, Saalim
      the son of Ibn `Umar, Qaasim bin Muhammad, `Abdullaah bin Deenaar &amp; `Ataa'.
      Also, `Abdur Rahmaan bin Mahdi said, "This is from the Sunnah", it was
      practised by the Imaam of the Sunnah, Ahmad bin Hanbal, and it has been quoted
      from Maalik &amp; Shaafi`i .<p>
      <a name="fn81"><font size=+1><b>82</b></font></a>Ibn Khuzaimah (1/76/1), Daaraqutni &amp; Haakim, who
      declared it <tt>saheeh</tt> and Dhahabi agreed. All the ahaadeeth which
      contradict this are inauthentic. This way has been endorsed by Maalik, and
      similar is reported from Ahmad in Ibn al-Jawzi's <tt>al-Tahqeeq</tt> (108/2).
      Also, al-Marwazi quoted with a <tt>saheeh</tt> isnaad, Imam al-Awzaa`i in his
      <tt>Masaa'il</tt> (1/147/1) as saying, "I found the people placing their hands
      before their knees."<p>
      <a name="fn82"><font size=+1><b>83</b></font></a>Abu Daawood, Tammaam in <tt>al-Fawaa'id</tt>, &amp;
      Nasaa'i in <tt>Sunan as-Sughraa</tt> and <tt>Sunan al-Kubraa</tt> (47/1) with a
      <tt>saheeh</tt> isnaad.  `Abdul Haqq declared it <tt>saheeh</tt> in
      <tt>al-Ahkaam</tt> (54/1), and went on to say in <tt>Kitaab al-Tahajjud</tt>
      (56/1), "it has a sounder isnaad than the previous one", i.e. the hadeeth of
      Waa'il which is the other way round (knees before hands). In fact, the latter
      hadeeth, as well as being contradictory to this <tt>saheeh</tt> hadeeth and the
      preceding one, is neither authentic in isnaad nor in meaning, as I have
      explained in <tt>Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da`eefah</tt> (no. 929) and
      <tt>al-Irwaa'</tt> (357).<p>
      <p>
      It should be known that the way to differ from the camel is to place the hands
      before the knees, because the camel places its knees first; a camel's "knees"
      are in its forelegs, as defined in <tt>Lisaan al-`Arab</tt> and other books of
      the `Arabic language, and as mentioned by Tahaawi in <tt>Mushkil
      al-Aathaar</tt> and <tt>Sharh Ma`aani al-Aathaar</tt>. Also, Imaam Qaasim
      al-Saraqusti (rahimahullaah) narrated in <tt>Ghareeb al-Hadeeth</tt>
      (2/70/1-2), with a <tt>saheeh</tt> isnaad, Abu Hurairah's statement, "No one
      should kneel the way a runaway camel does", and then added, "This is in sajdah.
      He is saying that one should not throw oneself down, as a runaway (or untamed)
      camel does, hurriedly and without calmness, but he should go down calmly,
      placing his hands first, followed by his knees, and an explanatory <tt>marfoo`
      </tt>hadeeth has been narrated in this regard." He then mentioned the hadeeth
      above.<p>
      <p>
      As for Ibn al-Qayyim's extremely strange statement, "These words are
      incomprehensible, and not understood by the experts of the language", it is
      answered by the sources which we have mentioned, and also many others which can
      be consulted. I have also expanded on this in the refutation against Shaikh
      Tuwaijari, which may be published.<p>
      <a name="fn83"><font size=+1><b>84</b></font></a>Ibn Khuzaimah(1/79/2), Ahmad &amp; Siraaj;  Haakim

      different narration.<p>
      <a name="fn87"><font size=+1><b>88</b></font></a>Abu Daawood &amp; Tirmidhi, who declared it

      Isbahaan</tt>.<p>
      <a name="fn93"><font size=+1><b>94</b></font></a>Baihaqi with a saheeh isnaad. Ibn Abi Shaibah (1/82/2)
      &amp; Siraaj have related the pointing of the toes in a different narration.<p>
      <a name="fn94"><font size=+1><b>95</b></font></a>Bukhaari &amp; Abu Daawood. Ibn Sa`d (4/157) related
      from Ibn `Umar that he liked to point whatever of his body he could towards the
      <tt>qiblah</tt> when praying, even his thumbs.<p>
      <a name="fn95"><font size=+1><b>96</b></font></a>Tahaawi, Ibn Khuzaimah (no. 654) &amp; Haakim, who
      declared it <tt>saheeh</tt> and Dhahabi agreed.<p>
      <a name="fn96"><font size=+1><b>97</b></font></a>Baihaqi with a <tt>saheeh</tt> isnaad.<p>
      <a name="fn97"><font size=+1><b>98</b></font></a>Tirmidhi &amp; Siraaj; Haakim declared it
      <tt>saheeh</tt> and Dhahabi agreed.<p>
      <a name="fn98"><font size=+1><b>99</b></font></a>This movement of the hand was deduced from the grammar
      of the `Arabic text. (<tt>Fath al-Baari</tt>)<p>
      <a name="fn99"><font size=+1><b>100</b></font></a>i.e. to draw them in and prevent them from being
      scattered, meaning to gather the garment or hair with the hands for rukoo` and
      sujood. (<tt>Nihaayah</tt>). This forbiddance is not only during prayer; the
      majority of scholars include tucking in the hair and garments before prayer in
      the prohibition. This is further strengthened by his forbidding men to pray
      with their hair tied, which follows later.<p>
      <a name="fn100"><font size=+1><b>101</b></font></a>Bukhaari &amp; Muslim. It is given in
      <tt>al-Irwaa'</tt> (310).<p>
      <a name="fn101"><font size=+1><b>102</b></font></a>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah &amp; Ibn Hibbaan.<p>
      <a name="fn102"><font size=+1><b>103</b></font></a>i.e. tied up or plaited.<p>
      <a name="fn103"><font size=+1><b>104</b></font></a>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah &amp; Ibn Hibbaan.  Ibn al-Atheer
      says, "The meaning of this hadeeth is that were his hair loose, it would fall
      on the ground when in sajdah; hence, the man would be rewarded for the
      prostration of the hair.  However, if the hair is tied, it is effectively as
      though it did not prostrate, for he compared him to someone whose hands are
      shackled together, since they would then not lie on the ground in sajdah."<p>
      <p>
      It would seem that this instruction is limited to men and does not apply to
      women, as Shawkaani has quoted from Ibn al-`Arabi.<p>
      <a name="fn104"><font size=+1><b>105</b></font></a>Abu Daawood &amp; Tirmidhi, who declared it hasan; Ibn
      Khuzaimah &amp; Ibn Hibbaan declared it saheeh. See <tt>Saheeh Abi

      <a name="fn127"><font size=+1><b>128</b></font>Nasaa'i, Ibn `Asaakir (4/257/1-2) &amp; Haakim, who declared it

      <a name="fn128"><font size=+1><b>129</b></font>Ibn Khuzaimah in his Saheeh, with a <tt>hasan</tt> isnaad from
      Ibn Mas'ood (887) &amp; Baihaqi in <tt>mursal</tt> form. Ibn Khuzaimah prefixed
      it with, "Chapter: evidence that gesturing which is understood during prayer
      neither invalidates nor spoils the prayer" - this action is one which the
      People of Opinion have prohibited!  In this regard, there are also ahaadeeth in
      Bukhaari, Muslim and others.<p>
      <a name="fn129"><font size=+1><b>130</b></font></a>i.e. its colour is pure black, with no other colours
      mixed with it. (<tt>Nihaayah</tt>)<p>
      <a name="fn130"><font size=+1><b>131</b></font></a>the whiteness refers to that part of the horse where
      chains and bangles are put, including the lower legs but not the knees.<p>
      <a name="fn131"><font size=+1><b>132</b></font></a>i.e. the shining of the face due to the light of
      sujood.<p>
      <a name="fn132"><font size=+1><b>133</b></font></a>i.e. the shining of the parts covered in ablution: the
      face, hands and feet. The shining marks of ablution on the face, hands and legs
      of humans is compared to the whiteness of a horse's face and legs.<p>
      <a name="fn133"><font size=+1><b>134</b></font></a>Ahmad, with a <tt>saheeh</tt> isnaad.  Tirmidhi
      related a part of it and declared it <tt>saheeh</tt>. It is given in
      <tt>Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</tt>.<p>
      <a name="fn134"><font size=+1><b>135</b></font></a>Bukhaari &amp; Muslim;  the hadeeth shows that the
      sinful from among those regular at Prayer, will not remain the Fire forever;
      in fact, even those given to missing prayers out of laziness will not remain in
      the Fire forever, this is authentic - see <tt>as-Saheehah </tt>(2054).<p>
      <a name="fn135"><font size=+1><b>136</b></font></a> Ar.  <tt>haseer:</tt>  a mat made of date-palm leaves
      or straw, etc.<p>
      <a name="fn136"><font size=+1><b>137</b></font></a>This was because his mosque was not covcered with
      mats, etc. This is evident from a great many ahaadeeth, such as the next one
      and the one of Abu Sa`eed later.<p>
      <a name="fn137"><font size=+1><b>138</b></font></a>Muslim &amp; Abu `Awaanah.<p>
      <a name="fn138"><font size=+1><b>139</b></font></a>Ahmad, Siraaj &amp; Baihaqi, with a saheeh isnaad.<p>

      <a name="fn140"><font size=+1><b>141</b></font>ibid. A <tt>khumrah</tt> is a piece of matting, palm-fibre, or
      other material which is big enough for a man to place his face on it in sajdah;
      the term does not apply to larger pieces.<p>
      <a name="fn141"><font size=+1><b>142</b></font></a>ibid.<p>
      <a name="fn142"><font size=+1><b>143</b></font></a>Muslim &amp; Abu `Awaanah.   Ar. <tt>labisa
      </tt>usually means 'to wear', but here it is used to mean 'to use', i.e. to sit
      on;  hence 'wearing' includes 'sitting on', so this indicates that it is
      prohibited (haraam) to sit on silk, because of the prohibition on wearing it
      established in the Saheehs of Bukhaari and Muslim, and others. In fact, a clear
      forbiddance of sitting on silk is related in these, so do not be confused by
      the fact that some leading scholars allow it.<p>
      <a name="fn143"><font size=+1><b>144</b></font></a>Bukhaari  &amp; Muslim.<p>
      <a name="fn144"><font size=+1><b>145</b></font></a>Abu Daawood &amp; Haakim who declared it
      <tt>saheeh</tt> and Dhahabi agreed.<p>
      <a name="fn145"><font size=+1><b>146</b></font></a>Bukhaari  in his <tt>Juz' Raf` al-Yadain</tt>, Abu
      Daawood with a <tt>saheeh</tt> isnaad, Muslim &amp; Abu `Awaanah. It is given
      in <tt>Irwaa'</tt> (316).<p>
      <p>
      To raise the hands here, and with every takbeer, was a view voiced by Ahmad, as
      in Ibn al-Qayyim's <tt>Badaa'i` </tt>(3/89): "Athram quoted from him (Imaam
      Ahmad) that on being asked about raising the hands, he said: With every
      movement down and up. Athram said: I saw Abu `Abdullaah (i.e. Imaam Ahmad)
      raising his hands in prayer with every movement down and up."<p>
      <p>
      This was also the opinion of Ibn al-Mundhir &amp; Abu `Ali of the Shaafi`is,
      and also a view of Maalik and Shaafi`i  themselves, as in <tt>Tarh
      at-Tathreeb</tt>. The raising of the hands here is also authentically-reported
      from Anas bin Maalik, Ibn `Umar, Naafi`, Taawoos, Hasan Basri, Ibn Seereen
      &amp; Ayyoob as-Sikhtiaani, as in <tt>Musannaf Ibn Abi  Shaibah</tt> (1/106)
      with saheeh narrations from them.<p>
      <a name="fn146"><font size=+1><b>147</b></font></a>Ahmad &amp; Abu Daawood with a good isnaad.<p>
      <a name="fn147"><font size=+1><b>148</b></font></a>Bukhaari &amp; Baihaqi .<p>
      <a name="fn148"><font size=+1><b>149</b></font></a>Nasaa'i with a saheeh isnaad.<p>
      <a name="fn149"><font size=+1><b>150</b></font></a>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah, Abu Shaikh in <tt>Maa Rawaahu
      Abu az-Zubair `an Ghair Jaabir</tt> (nos. 104-6) &amp; Baihaqi .<p>
      <a name="fn150"><font size=+1><b>151</b></font></a>ibid. Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) overlooked this,
      so after mentioning the Prophet's (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) iftiraash
      between the two sajdahs, he said, "No other way of sitting here is preserved
      from him" !  How can this be correct, when iq`aa' has reached us via:  the
      hadeeth of Ibn `Abbaas in  Muslim, Abu Daawood &amp; Tirmidhi, who declared it
      saheeh, and others (see <tt>Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</tt> 383);  the
      hadeeth of Ibn `Umar with a hasan isnaad in Baihaqi, declared saheeh by Ibn
      Hajar.  Also, Abu Ishaaq al-Harbi related in <tt>Ghareeb al-Hadeeth</tt>
      (5/12/1) from Taawoos, who saw Ibn `Umar and Ibn `Abbaas practising iq`aa';
      its sanad is saheeh.  May Allaah shower His Mercy on Imaam Maalik, who said,
      "Every one of us can refute and be refuted, except the occupant of this grave",
      and he pointed to the grave of the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam).
      This sunnah was practised by several Companions, Successors and others, and I
      have expanded on this in <tt>al-Asl</tt>. <p>
      <p>
      Of course, this iq`aa' is different to the one which is forbidden, and follows
      under "Tashahhud".<p>
      <a name="fn151"><font size=+1><b>152</b></font></a>Abu Daawood &amp; Baihaqi  with a saheeh isnaad.<p>
      <a name="fn152"><font size=+1><b>153</b></font></a>Abu Daawood &amp; Haakim , who declared it saheeh and
      Dhahabi  agreed.<p>
      <a name="fn153"><font size=+1><b>154</b></font></a>Bukhaari  &amp; Muslim.<p>
      <a name="fn154"><font size=+1><b>155</b></font></a>ibid.  Ibn al-Qayyim said, "This sunnah was abandoned
      by the people after the time of the Companions.  But as for the one who abides
      by the Sunnah, and does not glance sideways towards whatever contradicts it, he
      is unworried by anything opposing this guidance."<p>
      <a name="fn155"><font size=+1><b>156</b></font></a>Abu Daawood, Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah &amp; Haakim , who
      declared it saheeh and Dhahabi  agreed.<p>
      <a name="fn156"><font size=+1><b>157</b></font></a>Ibn Maajah with a hasan sanad.  Imaam Ahmad chose to
      supplicate with this one;  Ishaaq bin Raahawaih said, "If he wishes, he can say
      this three times, or he can say O Allaah! Forgive me ..., because both of them
      have been reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) between the
      two sajdahs."  (<tt>Masaa'il of Imaam Ahmad &amp; Ishaaq bin Raahawaih as
      related by Ishaaq al-Marwazi,</tt> p. 19).<p>
      <a name="fn157"><font size=+1><b>158</b></font></a>This does not negate the validity of the expressions
      in the obligatory prayers due to the absence of anything to differentiate
      between those and voluntary prayers.  This is the view of Shaafi`i, Ahmad &amp;
      Ishaaq, who held that this was allowed in compulsory and voluntary prayers, as
      Tirmidhi  has narrated.  Imaam Tahaawi has also taken this view in <tt>Mushkil
      al-Aathaar</tt>.  Proper analysis supports this argument, for there is no
      position in prayer where a dhikr is not valid, and so it is fitting that this
      should be the case here.<p>

      <tt>jalsah al-istiraahah</tt> (the sitting of rest) by the scholars of fiqh.
      Shaafi`i  supported it, as did Ahmad in <tt>Tahqeeq</tt> (111/1) and favoured
      it more strongly, as is well-known of him that he would insist on following a
      sunnah which had nothing to contradict it.  Ibn Haani said in his <tt>Masaa'il
      of Imaam Ahmad</tt> (p. 42), "I saw Abu `Abdullaah (i.e. Imaam Ahmad) sometimes
      leaning on his hands when standing up for the next rak`ah, and sometimes
      sitting straight and then getting up."  It was also the preference of Imaam
      Ishaaq bin Raahawaih, who said in Marwazi's <tt>Masaa'il </tt>(1/147/2), "The
      example was set by the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) of supporting
      himself with his hands when getting up, whether he was old or young."  See also
      <tt>Irwaa' </tt>(2/82-3).<p>

      meaning is found in Baihaqi  with a saheeh sanad.  As for the hadeeth, "He used
      to get up like an arrow, not supporting himself with his hands", it is mawdoo`
      (fabricated), and all narrations of similar meaning are weak, not authentic,
      and I have explained this in <tt>Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da`eefah</tt> (562,
      929, 968). <p>
