It is thus in most of the narrations; 
in some, it is <i>wa ana min al-muslimeen</i> 
("I am one of the Muslims"). It is likely 
that this is because of the mistake of 
one of the narrators, and other evidence 
points to that, so the worshipper should 
say:<i> wa ana min al-muslimeen</i> ("I 
am the first of the Muslims"). There 
is nothing wrong with that, contrary 
to what some people say under the impression 
that this means "I am the first person 
who has this quality, while the rest 
of the people do not." But it is not 
so; this phrase actually represents competing 
to fulfil orders - similar to this is 
<b>"Say: if the Merciful God has a son, 
then I am the first of the worshippers"</b> 
(<tt>Zukhruf 43:81</tt>) and the saying 
of Moosa (`alaihis salam), <b>"and I 
am the first of the believers."</b> (<tt>A`raaf 
7:143</tt>)</font>

i.e. Evil cannot be traced back to Allaah 
because there is nothing bad in His actions, 
for they are all good, ranging from justice 
to grace to wisdom, all of which are 
good with no bad in them. But evil is 
evil because it cannot be traced back 
to Allaah. Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) 
said: "He is the Creator of good and 
evil, but the evil exists in some of 
His creatures, not in His act of creating 
nor in His actions. Hence the Exalted 
is cleared of any <tt>zulm,</tt> which 
is fundamentally to put something in 
other than its proper place. He does 
not put anything except in its suitable 
place, so that is all good. But evil 
is to put something in other than its 
proper place: when it is put in its proper 
place it is not evil, so be sure that 
evil is not from Him. ...But if it is 
said: Why did He create something which 
is evil? I would say: He did the creating, 
and His action is good not evil, for 
creation and action is with Allaah, and 
it is impossible for evil to be with, 
or attributed to, Allaah. Anything evil 
in the created cannot be traced back 
to Allaah, but His actions and His creation 
can be attributed to Him, so they are 
good." The rest of this important discussion 
as well as its conclusion is to be found

it saheeh and Dhahabi agreed. `Uqaili 
said (p. 103): "this has been narrated 
via several routes with good isnaads."
