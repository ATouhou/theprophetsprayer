      Sunnah is to sit <tt>muftarishan</tt>.  This difference in detail is documented
      from Imaam Ahmad, cf. Ibn Hani's <tt>Masaa'il of Imaam Ahmad</tt> (p. 79).<p>

      <p>
      It should be known that this hadeeth proves that salaah (sending prayers) on
      the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) in this tashahhud is obligatory,
      due to the command about it.  This opinion was taken by Imaam Shaafi`i  and by
      Imaam Ahmad in the later of the two narrations from him, and before them by
      several Companions, as well as other people of knowledge.  Because of this,
      Aajuri said in <tt>Sharee`ah</tt> (p. 415): "He who does not send prayers on
      the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) in the final tashahhud must repeat
      the prayer."  Hence, those who label Imaam Shaafi`i  as being alone and odd in
      his opinion on this, are not being just, as the faqeeh Haitami has explained in
      <tt>Darr al-Mandood</tt> (sections 13-16).<p>
      <a name="fn255"><font size=+1><b>256</b></font>Nasaa'i with a saheeh sanad.<p>
      <a name="fn256"><font size=+1><b>257</b></font></a>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah, Nasaa'i &amp; Ibn al-Jaarood in
      <tt>al-Muntaqaa</tt> (27). It is given in Irwaa' (350).<p>

      <a name="fn259"><font size=+1><b>260</b></font></a>We have not said, "... in his tashahhud" because the
      text is "... in his prayer", not specifying either tashahhud or anything else.
      Hence, it covers all positions suitable for supplication, e.g. prostration and
      tashahhud; the instruction to supplicate in these two postures has been
      mentioned.<p>
      <a name="fn260"><font size=+1><b>261</b></font></a>Bukhaari  &amp; Muslim.  Athram said, "I asked Ahmad:
      'With what (words) should I supplicate after tashahhud ?' He said, 'As has been
      narrated.'  I said, 'Didn't the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu `alaihi wa
      sallam) say, "Then he should select whichever supplication he likes" ?'  He
      said, 'He should select out of what has been narrated.' I repeated the
      question: he said, 'From what has been narrated'."  This was quoted by Ibn
      Taymiyyah (<tt>Majmoo` al-Fataawaa</tt> 69/218/1), who endorsed it, adding,
      "Hence, 'whichever supplication' refers to the supplications which Allaah
      loves, not to any supplication ...";  later he said, "Hence, it is best to say:
      (one should supplicate) with the approved, established supplications, and these
      are what have ben narrated and those that are beneficial." This is so, but to
      recognise which supplications are indeed beneficial depends on authentic
      knowledge, and this is rarely found among the people, so it is best to stick to
      the supplications quoted, especially when they include what the worshipper
      wishes to request.  Allaah knows best.<p>

      <a name="fn262"><font size=+1><b>263</b></font><tt>maghram:</tt> burden; here it means debt, as proved
      by the rest of the hadeeth, in which `Aa'ishah said, "Someone said to him, `Why
      do you seek refuge from maghram, so often, O Messenger of Allaah ?' He replied,
      <tt>Truly, when a man becomes indebted, he speaks and lies, and he promises and
      breaks his promise.</tt><p>

      audible, but the words are incomprehensible - in the case, the quiet words of

      <a name="fn273"><font size=+1><b>274</b></font></a>This is <tt>tawassul</tt> (a seeking of approach) to
      Allaah through His most beautiful names and attributes, and this is what Allaah
      the Exalted commands: <b>"To Allaah belong the most beautiful names, so call on
      Him by them." </b>(A`raaf 7:180). As for seeking to approaching Allaah through
      other things, e.g. for so-and-so's sake, or by so-and-so's right, status,
      dignity, etc., there is text from Imaam Abu Haneefah (rahimahullaah) and his
      companions that such a practice is at least disliked (makrooh); in general it
      is prohibited (haraam). Therefore, it is a pity that one sees most of the
      people, among them many shaikhs, totally neglecting the approved tawassul, -
      you will never hear them approaching Allaah this way - but they are well-versed
      in innovated forms of tawassul, which are at the very least debatable, as
      though no other way is allowed! Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah has composed an
      extremely good essay on this subject entitled <tt>Tawassul and Waseelah</tt>
      ("Approaching Allaah, and the Means of doing so"), which should be consulted,
      for it is very important, and there is little to compare with it in its
      coverage.  There is also my article <tt>Tawassul - its types and its
      rules</tt>, which is also important in its subject-matter and format, and also
      refutes some of the latest misconceptions advanced by contemporary doctors of
      religion. May Allaah guide us and them.<p>
