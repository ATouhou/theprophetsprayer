      <a name="fn177"><font size=+1><b>178</b></font></a>Tayaalisi, Ahmad &amp; Ibn Abi  Shaibah.  About
      iq`aa', Abu `Ubaidah and others said, "It is when a man presses his buttocks
      against the ground, keeps his shins upright, and leans his hands on the ground,
      the way a dog does."  This is different to the iq`aa' between sajdahs, which is
      approved in the Sunnah, as covered previously.<p>
      <a name="fn178"><font size=+1><b>179</b></font></a>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah &amp; others.  It is given in
      <tt>Irwaa' </tt>(316).<p>

      <a name="fn180"><font size=+1><b>181</b></font></a>Abu Daawood &amp; Nasaa'i with a saheeh sanad.  It is
      as though the meaning is that he would not separate his elbows from his side,
      as Ibn al-Qayyim has elucidated in <tt>Zaad al-Ma`aad</tt>.<p>
      <a name="fn181"><font size=+1><b>182</b></font></a>Baihaqi  &amp; Haakim , who declared it saheeh and
      Dhahabi  agreed.  It is given, as well as the next one, in Irwaa' (380).<p>
      <a name="fn182"><font size=+1><b>183</b></font></a>Ahmad &amp; Abu Daawood with a good isnaad.<p>
      <a name="fn183"><font size=+1><b>184</b></font></a>`Abdur Razzaaq; `Abdul Haqq declared it saheeh in his
      <tt>Ahkaam</tt> (no. 1284 - with my checking).<p>
      <a name="fn184"><font size=+1><b>185</b></font></a>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah &amp; Ibn Khuzaimah.  Humaidi
      (13/1) and Abu Ya`laa (275/2) added with a saheeh sanad on the authority of Ibn
      `Umar: "and this is the shooting of the devil; no-one will forget when he does
      this", and Humaidi raised his finger.  Humaidi also said that Muslim bin Abi
      Maryam said, "A man related to me that in a church in Syria, he saw images of
      Prophets depicted like this", and Humaidi raised his finger.  This is an
      extremely strange remark, but its sanad up to "the man" is saheeh.<p>
      <a name="fn185"><font size=+1><b>186</b></font></a>Muslim &amp; Abu `Awaanah.<p>
      <a name="fn186"><font size=+1><b>187</b></font></a>Abu Daawood, Nasaa'i, Ibn al-Jaarood in
      <tt>al-Muntaqaa</tt> (208), Ibn Khuzaimah (1/86/1-2) &amp; Ibn Hibbaan in his
      Saheeh (485) with a saheeh sanad.  Ibn al-Mulaqqin also declared it saheeh
      (28/2), and it has a supporting narration in Ibn `Adi (287/1).<p>
      <a name="fn187"><font size=+1><b>188</b></font></a>ibid.  About "supplicating with it", Imaam Tahaawi
      said, "This is evidence that it was at the end of the prayer."  Hence, there is
      evidence in this that the Sunnah is to continue pointing and moving the finger
      until the tasleem, for the supplication is until then.  This is the view of
      Maalik and others.  Imaam Ahmad was asked, "Should a man point with his finger
      during prayer?"  He replied, "Yes, vigorously." (Mentioned by Ibn Haani in his
      <tt>Masaa'il of Imaam Ahmad</tt>, 1/80).  From this, it is clear that moving
      the finger in tashahhud is a proven sunnah of the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi
      wa sallam), and it was practised by Ahmad and other imaams of the Sunnah.
      Therefore,  those who think that it is pointless and irrelevant and has nothing
      to do with the Prayer, should fear Allaah, since because of this, they do not
      move their fingers although they know it to be an established sunnah; and they
      take great pains to interpret it in a way which is inconsistent with the
      `Arabic way of expression and contrary to the understanding of the imaams with
      regard to it.<p>
      <p>
      The amazing thing is that some of them will defend an imaam on other issues,
      even if his opinion conflicts with the Sunnah, with the argument that to point
      out the imaam's mistakes inevitably means to taunt and disrespect him.  They
      then forget this and reject this established sunnah, at the same time mocking
      at those who practise it.  Whether or not they realise it, their mockery also
      includes those imaams whom they often defend wrongly, and who are correct about
      the Sunnah this time!  In fact, they are deriding the Prophet (sallallaahu
      `alaihi wa sallam) himself, for he is the one who brought us this sunnah, and
      so jeering at it is equivalent to jeering at him.  &lt;&lt; <b>But what is the
      reward for those among you who behave like this except</b> ... &gt;&gt;<p>
      <p>
      As for putting the finger down after pointing, or limiting the movement to the
      affirmation (saying <tt>laa ilaaha</tt>: 'there is no god ...') and negation
      (saying: <tt>illallaahu</tt>: '... except Allaah'), all of that has no basis in
      the Sunnah;  in fact, it is contrary to the Sunnah, as this hadeeth proves.<p>
      <p>
      Further, the hadeeth that he would not move his finger does not have an
      authentic isnaad, as I have explained in <tt>Da`eef Abi  Daawood</tt> (175).
      Even if it were authentic, it is negatory, while the hadeeth above is
      affirmatory:  the affirmatory takes precedence over the negatory, as is
      well-known among the scholars.<p>
      <a name="fn188"><font size=+1><b>189</b></font></a>Ahmad, Bazzaar, Abu Ja`far al-Bukhteeri in
      <tt>al-Amaali</tt> (60/1), `Abdul Ghani al-Maqdisi in his Sunan (12/2) with a
      hasan sanad, Rooyaani in his Musnad (249/2) &amp; Baihaqi .<p>
      <a name="fn189"><font size=+1><b>190</b></font></a>Ibn Abi  Shaibah (2/123/2) with a hasan sanad.<p>

      narration for it in Ibn Abi  Shaibah.<p>

      <a name="fn193"><font size=+1><b>194</b></font></a>Baihaqi  transmitted it as a narration from `Aa'ishah
      with a good isnaad, as verified by Ibn al-Mulaqqin (28/2).<p>
      <a name="fn194"><font size=+1><b>195</b></font></a>Bukhaari  &amp; Muslim.  It is given in <tt>Irwaa'

      al-Kabeer</tt> (3/25/1) with a saheeh sanad.  The literal meaning of the
      hadeeth is evidence for the validity of supplication in every tashahhud, even
      the one not adjacent to the tasleem, and this is the view of Ibn Hazm
      (rahimahullaah).<p>

      <a name="fn201"><font size=+1><b>202</b></font></a>Ar. <tt>tayyibaat</tt>, i.e. "all good and pure words

      with which kings were greeted."  (<tt>Fath al-Baari</tt>)<p>
      <a name="fn202"><font size=+1><b>203</b></font></a>meaning seeking of refuge with Allaah and being
      strengthened by him, since <tt>as-Salaam</tt> (Peace) is actually a name of
      Allaah.  Hence, the greeting effectively means: Allaah be a watcher and
      safeguard over you.  Similarly, it is said, "Allaah be with you", i.e. in His
      safeguarding, help and favour.<p>
      <a name="fn203"><font size=+1><b>204</b></font></a>A term for all the good continuously emanating from
      Allaah.<p>
      <a name="fn204"><font size=+1><b>205</b></font></a>Bukhaari, Muslim, Ibn Abi  Shaibah (1/90/2), Siraaj
      &amp; Abu Ya`laa in his Musnad (258/2).  It is given in <tt>Irwaa'</tt>
      (321).<p>
      <p>
      Ibn Mas`ood's statement, "We said: Peace be on the Prophet" clarifies that the
      Companions (radi Allaahu `anhum) used to say, "Peace be on you, O Prophet" in
      tashahhud while the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) was alive, but when
      he died, they ceased to do that, instead saying, "Peace be on the Prophet".
      Undoubtedly, this was with the endorsement of the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi
      wa sallam); this is supported by the fact that `Aa'ishah (radi Allaahu `anhaa)
      would similarly teach the tashahhud in prayer with "Peace be on the Prophet",
      as transmitted by Siraaj   in his Musnad (9/1/2) &amp; Mukhlis in
      <tt>al-Fawaa'id</tt> (11/54/1) with two saheeh isnaads from her.<p>
      Ibn Hajar says, "This addition shows clearly that they used to say 'Peace be on
      you, O Prophet', addressing him directly during his life, but when the Prophet
      (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) died, they stopped addressing him and mentioned
      him in the third person instead, saying 'Peace be on the Prophet'."  He also
      says in a different place, "Subki said in <tt>Sharh al-Minhaaj</tt>, after
      mentioning this narration from Abu `Awaanah only, 'If this is
      authentically-reported from the Companions, it proves that after his time, it
      is not compulsory to address the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam)
      directly in the greeting of peace, so one says: Peace be on the Prophet.'  (Ibn
      Hajar continues:) This is authentic without doubt (i.e. because it is
      established in Sahih al-Bukhaari ), and I have also found strong support for
      it:- `Abdur Razzaaq said: Ibn Juraij informed me: `Ataa' informed me that the
      Companions used to say 'Peace be on you, O Prophet' while the Prophet
      (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) was alive, but after he died, they would say
      'Peace be on the Prophet', and this is a saheeh isnaad.  As for Sa`eed bin
      Mansoor's narration from Abu `Ubaidah bin `Abdullaah bin Mas`ood, who reported
      from his father that the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) taught them
      the tashahhud, and then he (`Abdullaah bin Mas`ood) said it (the tashahhud);
      Ibn `Abbaas said: We used to say 'Peace be on you, O Prophet' only while he was
      alive, to which Ibn Mas`ood replied, 'This is how we were taught, and this is
      how we teach it',  it would appear that Ibn `Abbaas said this as a matter of
      discussion but Ibn Mas`ood did not accept.  However, the narration of Abu
      Ma`mar (i.e. the narration of Bukhaari ) is more authentic, since Abu `Ubaidah
      did not hear (ahaadeeth) from his father, and furthermore, the isnaad up to Abu
      `Ubaidah is weak." (End of quote from Ibn Hajar)<p>
      <p>
      These words of Ibn Hajar have been quoted by several scholars in their
      analysis, e.g. Qastalaani, Zarqaani, Lucknowi, etc.  They all chose to give his
      words without commenting further.  This discussion is treated more fully in
      <tt>al-Asl</tt>. <p>
      <a name="fn205"><font size=+1><b>206</b></font></a>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah, Shaafi`i  &amp; Nasaa'i .<p>
      <a name="fn206"><font size=+1><b>207</b></font></a>see next note.<p>
      <a name="fn207"><font size=+1><b>208</b></font></a>These two additions have been proved to be part of the
      tashahhud from the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam).  Ibn `Umar did not
      add them of his own accord (far is he above such a thing! );  in fact, he
      learnt them from other Companions who reported them from the Prophet
      (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam), and he then added them to the tashahhud which
      he heard from the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) directly.<p>
      <a name="fn208"><font size=+1><b>209</b></font></a>Abu Daawood &amp; Daaraqutni, who declared it
      saheeh.<p>
      <a name="fn209"><font size=+1><b>210</b></font>Muslim, Abu `Awaanah, Abu Daawood &amp; Ibn Maajah.<p>
      <a name="fn210"><font size=+1><b>211</b></font></a>Maalik &amp; Baihaqi  with saheeh isnaads.  Although
      this hadeeth is <tt>mawqoof</tt>, it is effectively <tt>marfoo`</tt>, for it is
      known that this sort of thing is not said from personal opinion, since it were
      so, it would be no better than any other sayings of <tt>dhikr</tt>, as Ibn
      `Abdul Barr has said.<p>
      <p>
      <b>*NB:</b>  In none of the types of tashahhud is there the addition: <tt>wa
      maghfiratuhu</tt> (... "and His forgiveness"), so one should not be accustomed
      to it.  Hence some of the Salaf rebuked it, as the following narrations show:
      <p>
      <p>
      Tabaraani (3/56/1) reported with a saheeh isnaad from Talhah bin Musarrif, who
      said:  Rabee` bin Khaitham added during tashahhud, "... and His blessings,
      <tt>and His forgiveness</tt>"!  So `Alqamah said, "We stop where we were
      taught:  Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allaah and His
      blessings";  `Alqamah was actually following the example of his teacher
      `Abdullaah bin Mas`ood (radi Allaahu `anhu), from whom it is
      authentically-reported that he was teaching a man the tashahhud:  when he got
      to "I bear witness that there is no (true) god except Allaah ...", the man
      said: "alone, He has no partner", to which `Abdullaah said, "He is so, but we
      stop at where we were taught."  (Transmitted by Tabaraani in <tt>Mu`jam
      al-Awsat</tt>, no. 2848, with a saheeh isnaad.)<p>
      <a name="fn211"><font size=+1><b>212</b></font></a>Abu `Awaanah in his Saheeh (2/324) &amp; Nasaa'i .<p>
      <a name="fn212"><font size=+1><b>213</b></font></a>They had said, "O Messenger of Allaah, we have been
      taught how to send peace on you (i.e. in tashahhud), but how do we send prayers
      on you?  He said, "Say: O Allaah! send prayers on Muhammad ..." etc.  Thus he
      did not specify one tashahhud to the exclusion of another, so there is evidence
      here to establish sending prayers on him in the first tashahhud also.  This is
      the way of Imaam Shaafi`i, as in the text of his book <tt>al-Umm</tt>, and it
      is held to be correct by his companions, as Nawawi has explained in
      <tt>al-Majmoo`</tt> (3/460) and supported in <tt>Rawdah Taalibeen</tt> (1/263).
      It is also the view of Wazeer bin Hubairah al-Hanbali in al-Ifsaah, as Ibn
      Rajab ha quoted and strongly supported in <tt>Dhail Tabaqaat</tt> (1/280).
      Many ahaadeeth exist about sending prayers on him (sallallaahu `alaihi wa
      sallam) in tashahhud; in none of them is there any such specification
      mentioned.  In fact, these ahaadeeth are general, hence including every
      tashahhud, and I have given them in al-Asl as ta`leeq, but not in the main
      text, for they do not satisfy our conditions for authenticity.  However, they
      do support each other in meaning, and those who reject and oppose this have no
      authentic evidence to use as proof, as I have detailed in <tt>al-Asl.</tt>
      Similarly, to say that adding anything to "O Allaah! send prayers on Muhammad"
      is makrooh has no basis in the Sunnah, nor is there any convincing proof for
      it.  In fact, we see that whoever says this does not implement the previous
      instruction of the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam), "Say: O Allaah!
      send prayers on Muhammad, and on the family of Muhammad ..." ;  there is more
      to this discussion in <tt>al-Asl</tt>.<p>
      <a name="fn213"><font size=+1><b>214</b></font></a>One of the earliest views about the meaning of
      "sending prayers on the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam)" is that of Abu
      al-`Aaliyah (with reference to Surah al-Ahzaab, 33:56), "Allaah's sending
      prayers on his Prophet means His exalting him and raising his rank;  the
      angels' and others' sending prayers means their seeking this from Allaah, and
      here it is meant asking the prayers to be increased, not asking for the
      original prayer in itself."  Ibn Hajar quoted this in <tt>Fath al-Baari</tt>,
      and went on to refute the widespread notion that the Lord's prayer on someone
      is His Mercy;  Ibn al-Qayyim also clarified this in <tt>Jalaa' al-Afhaam</tt>,
      leaving little scope for further comment.<p>
      <a name="fn214"><font size=+1><b>215</b></font></a>from <tt>barakah</tt>: growth, increase.  Hence this
      supplication secures for Muhammad the good which Allaah granted to the family
      of Ibraaheem, continual, established good, as well as its multiplying and
      increase.<p>
      <a name="fn215"><font size=+1><b>216</b></font></a>Ahmad &amp; Tahaawi with a saheeh sanad.<p>
      <a name="fn216"><font size=+1><b>217</b></font></a>see next note.<p>
      <a name="fn217"><font size=+1><b>218</b></font></a>These two additions are conclusively found in
      Bukhaari, Tahaawi, Baihaqi, Ahmad &amp; Nasaa'i .  They also exist via
      different routes of narration in other types of this supplication (see nos.
      3,7), and so do not be confused by Ibn al-Qayyim's view in <tt>Jalaa'
      al-Afhaam</tt> (p. 198), following in the footsteps of his great teacher Ibn
      Taymiyyah in <tt>al-Fataawaa</tt> (1/16), "There is no authentic hadeeth with
      the phrases 'Ibraaheem' and 'the family of Ibraaheem' together";  here, we have
      shown you such authentic ahaadeeth.   Ibn al-Qayyim's error is further
      established by the fact that he himself declared no. 7 saheeh, which contains
      what he denied above!<p>

      <a name="fn228"><font size=+1><b>229</b></font></a>Bukhaari  &amp; Muslim.<p>
      <a name="fn229"><font size=+1><b>230</b></font></a>Abu Ya`laa in his Musnad (284/2) with a good isnaad.
      It is given in <tt>Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</tt> (604).<p>
      <a name="fn230"><font size=+1><b>231</b></font></a>Bukhaari  &amp; Abu Daawood.<p>
      <a name="fn231"><font size=+1><b>232</b></font>ibid.<p>
      <a name="fn232"><font size=+1><b>233</b></font></a>Abu `Awaanah &amp; Nasaa'i with a saheeh sanad.<p>
      <a name="fn233"><font size=+1><b>234</b></font></a>literally, "as one who kneads dough."<p>
      <a name="fn234"><font size=+1><b>235</b></font></a>Harbi in <tt>Ghareeb al-Hadeeth</tt>; its meaning is
      found in Bukhaari  and Abu Daawood.  As for the hadeeth, he forbade that a man
      should support himself with his hand when getting up during prayer", it is
      <tt>munkar</tt> and not authentic, as I have explained in <tt>Silsilah
      al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da`eefah</tt> (967).<p>
      <a name="fn235"><font size=+1><b>236</b></font><tt>Qunoot</tt>:  carries several meanings, e.g.
      humility, devotion. What is meant here is the special supplication while
      standing during prayer.<p>
      <a name="fn236"><font size=+1><b>237</b></font>Bukhaari  &amp; Ahmad.<p>
      <a name="fn237"><font size=+1><b>238</b></font></a>ibid.<p>
      <a name="fn238"><font size=+1><b>239</b></font></a>Ahmad &amp; Tabaraani with a saheeh sanad.  To raise
      the hands in qunoot is the madhhab of Ahmad and also Ishaaq bin Raahawaih, cf.
      Marwazi's <tt>Masaa'il</tt> (p. 23).  As for wiping the face with the hands, it
      is not reported in this position, and is thus an innovation;  as for outside of
      prayer, it is not authentically-reported: all that has been transmitted in this
      regard is either weak or very weak, as I have shown in <tt>Da`eef Abi
      Daawood</tt> (262) &amp; <tt>Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</tt> (597).
      This is why `Izz bin `Abd as-Salaam said in one of his fatwas, "Only an
      ignorant person does it."  See Appendix 8.<p>
      <a name="fn239"><font size=+1><b>240</b></font>Abu Daawood &amp; Siraaj  ;  Haakim   declared it saheeh, and
      Dhahabi  &amp; others agreed.<p>
      <a name="fn240"><font size=+1><b>241</b></font></a>Abu Daawood, Siraaj   &amp; Daaraqutni  with two hasan
      sanads.<p>
      <a name="fn241"><font size=+1><b>242</b></font></a>Ibn Khuzaimah in his Saheeh (1/78/2) &amp; Khateeb in
      <tt>Kitaab al-Qunoot</tt> with a saheeh sanad.<p>
      <a name="fn242"><font size=+1><b>243</b></font></a>Bukhaari  &amp; Ahmad; the addition is in Muslim.<p>
      <a name="fn243"><font size=+1><b>244</b></font></a>Nasaa'i, Ahmad, Siraaj   (109/1) &amp; Abu Ya`laa in
      his Musnad with a good sanad.<p>
      <a name="fn244"><font size=+1><b>245</b></font></a>Ibn Nasr &amp; Daaraqutni  with a saheeh sanad.<p>
      <a name="fn245"><font size=+1><b>246</b></font></a>We have said, "... sometimes" because the Companions
      who narrated the Witr prayer did not mention the qunoot in it, whereas had the
      Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) done so always, they would have all
      mentioned it.  However, Ubayy ibn Ka`b alone narrated the qunoot in Witr, so
      this shows that he used to do it sometimes.  Hence, this is evidence that
      qunoot in Witr is not obligatory (waajib), and this is the opinion of the
      majority of scholars.  For this reason, the researching Hanafi scholar, Ibn
      al-Humaam, recognised in <tt>Fath al-Qadeer</tt> (1/306,359,360) that the view
      of it being obligatory is feeble and not substantiated by evidence.  This shows
      his fairness and lack of party-spirit, for this view which he has supported is
      contrary to his madhhab !<p>
      <a name="fn246"><font size=+1><b>247</b></font></a>Ibn Abi  Shaibah (12/41/1), Abu Daawood, Nasaa'i in
      <tt>Sunan al-Kubraa</tt> (218/1-2), Ahmad, Tabaraani, Baihaqi &amp; Ibn
      `Asaakir (4/244/2) narrated this, along with the supplication after it, with a
      <tt>saheeh</tt> sanad. Ibn Mandah narrated the supplication only in
      <tt>Tawheed</tt> (70/2) with a different, hasan sanad. Its <tt>takhreej</tt> is
      also given in <tt>Irwaa'</tt> (426).<p>
      <a name="fn247"><font size=+1><b>248</b></font>Ibn Khuzaimah (1/119/2) &amp; also Ibn Abi  Shaibah etc., as for
      the last hadeeth.<p>
      <p>
      <b>*NB:</b>  Nasaa'i adds at the end of the qunoot: <tt>wa sall-Allaahu
      `ala-n-Nabiyy al-Ummiyy </tt>("may Allaah send prayers on the Unlettered
      Prophet"), related with a weak isnaad; among those who declared it da`eef are
      Ibn Hajar al-`Asqalaani &amp; Zurqaani.  Therefore, we have not included it in
      our system of combining acceptable narrations.  `Izz bin `Abd as-Salaam said in
      <tt>al-Fataawaa</tt> (66/1,1962), "To send prayers on the Messenger of Allaah
      (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) in qunoot is not authentic, nor is it fitting
      to add to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam)'s prayer in
      any way."  This view of his shows that he did not widen the argument by
      including the idea of bid`ah hasanah ("good" innovation), as some of the later
      scholars are prone to doing !<p>
      <p>
      However, it is proved in the hadeeth about Ubayy bin Ka`b leading the people
      during the Ramadaan night prayers that he used to send prayers on the Prophet
      (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) at the end of the qunoot, and that was during
      the reign of `Umar (radi Allaahu `anhu) - transmitted by Ibn Khuzaimah in his
      Saheeh (1097).  Similarly is proved from Abu Haleemah Mu`aadh al-Ansaari, who
      also used to lead them during `Umar's rule - transmitted by Ismaa`eel al-Qaadi
      (no. 107) &amp; others, so this addition is justified by the practice of the
      Salaf, and it is thus not fitting to categorically state that this addition is
      an innovation.  Allaah knows best.<p>
