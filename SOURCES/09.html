                            with the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu

                            lead his people in prayer. One night when 
                            he returned and prayed with them, a young 
                            man [called Sulaim, of the Banu Salamah] 
                            from his people prayed, but when it became 
                            too long for him, he [went away and] prayed 
                            [in the corner of the mosque], then came 
                            out, took the reins of his camel and departed. 
                            When Mu'aadh had prayed, this was mentioned 
                            to him, so he said: "He surely has some 
                            hypocrisy in him! I will surely tell the 
                            Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
                            wa sallam) what he has done." The young 
                            man said: "And I will tell the Messenger 
                            of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
                            what he has done." So in the morning they 
                            came to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
                            'alaihi wa sallam), and Mu'aadh informed 
                            him of what the young man had done. The 
                            young man said: "O Messenger of Allaah! 
                            He stays a long time with you, and then 
                            he returns and lengthens it for us." So 
                            the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
                            wa sallam) said: <b>Are you one who causes 
                            great trouble, Mu'aadh?!</b> and he said 
                            to the young man<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/09_fn.html#fn168"><sup>169</sup></a>:
