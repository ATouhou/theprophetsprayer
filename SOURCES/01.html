When I finished reading the book of prayer 
in At-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb by al-Haafiz 
al-Mundhiri (rahimahullaah) and teaching 
it to our brothers, four years ago, it 
became clear to us all the important 
position of the Prayer in Islaam; and 
the reward, grace and respect awaiting 
those who establish and perform it well; 
and that all this varies, depending on 
its closeness to the Prophet's prayer 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam). This 
is what he indicated in his saying, <b>Verily 
the slave prays a prayer of which nothing 
is written down for him except a tenth, 
ninth, eighth, seventh, sixth, fifth, 
quarter, third or half of it.</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn4"><sup>5</sup></a> 
Therefore, I reminded the brothers that 
it is not possible for us to perform 
prayer as it should be performed, or 
even approach that, unless we know the 
detailed description of the Prophet's 
prayer (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam), 
including its essentials, manners, forms, 
supplications (du'aas) and remembrances 
(adhkaar), and then we make an effort 
to put that knowledge into practice carefully, 
for then we could hope that our prayers 
would restrain us from shameful and unjust 
deeds, and that the reward and blessings 
mentioned in the narrations would be 
written down for us.</font> 
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
However, detailed familiarity with all 
these aspects of prayer is unlikely to 
be achieved by most people nowadays, 
even many scholars, because of their 
limiting themselves to a particular Madhhab. 
But, as anyone concerned with assisting 
in compiling and studying the purified 
Sunnah knows, in every Madhhab there 
are sunnahs which are not found in other 
Madhhabs; moreover, in every Madhhab 
there are sayings and actions which cannot 
be authentically traced back to the Prophet 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) - most 
of these are found in the sayings of 
the later scholars<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn5"><sup>6</sup></a>, 
many of whom we see firmly attributing 
these to the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam)!<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn6"><sup>7</sup></a> 
This is why the scholars of Hadeeth - 
may Allaah reward them well - have produced 
books of Takhreej on the famous books 
of the later scholars, explaining the 
rank of each hadeeth given in them: whether 
e.g. authentic, weak or fabricated. Examples 
of these books of Takhreej are: Al-'Inaayah 
fi Ma'rifah Ahaadeeth al- Hidaayah and 
At-Turuq wal-Wasaa'il fi Takhreej Ahaadeeth 
Khulaasah ad-Dalaa'il by Shaikh 'Abdul 
Qaadir ibn Muhammad al- Qurashi al-Hanafi; 
Nasb ar-Raayah li Ahaadeeth al-Hidaayah 
by Haafiz Zayla'i, and its abridged version 
ad-Dirayah by Haafiz Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaani, 
who also wrote Talkhees al-Habeer fi 
Takhreej Ahaadeeth ar-Raafi'i al-Kabir; 
there are many others, naming which will 
only lengthen this discussion.<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn7"><sup>8</sup></a>

<h2 align="left"><font size=+3> <a name="RTFToC2">Reasons 
behind the Compilation of this Book, 
and some of its Features </a></font></h2>
<div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 
I had not come across a comprehensive 
book covering this topic, I felt obliged 
to produce a book which collected together 
as many features of the Prophet's prayer 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) from 
the takbeer to the tasleem as possible, 
for the benefit of my Muslim brothers 
who wished to follow the guidance of 
their Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam) in their worship, such that it 
would be easy for any who truly loved 
the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
to use this book to fulfil his command, 
<b>"Pray as you have seen me praying."</b> 
</font> </div>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Thus I embarked on a difficult task, 
and researched the relevant ahaadeeth 
from the various sources of Hadeeth, 
the book in your hands being the end 
result of it all. I stipulated on myself 
that I would only give ahaadeeth which 
had an authentic sanad according to the 
principles and regulations of the science 
of Hadeeth. I disregarded any hadeeth 
which depended on unknown or weak narrators, 
whether it dealt with the outward form, 
adhkaar, excellence, etc. of the Prayer. 
This is because I hold that the authentic 
ahadeeth<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn8"><sup>9</sup></a> 
are sufficient, leaving no need for anything 
weak, for the latter does not amount 
to anything except zann (conjecture, 
suspicion), and incorrect conjecture 
at that; as the Exalted says:</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><tt><font color="#339900"><b><i><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"... 
And conjecture is of no use against the 
truth"</font></i></b></font></tt><a
href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn9"><sup>10</sup></a></font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
and the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam) said, <b>Beware of suspicion, 
for truly, suspicion is the most false 
of speech.</b><a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn10"><sup>11</sup></a> 
Therefore, we cannot worship Allaah by 
acting according to inauthentic ahaadeeth; 
in fact, the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) forbade us from this 
saying, Keep away from saying things 
about me, except what you know<a
href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn11"><sup>12</sup></a>; 
since he has forbidden us from relating 
weak narrations, it goes without saying 
that it is forbidden to act according 
to them.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
I have compiled the book as two texts: 
the main text and the subsidiary text.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
The main text includes the text of ahaadeeth 
or phrases taken from them, as well as 
appropriate words to string them together 
to give the book a fluency from start 
to finish. I have been careful to preserve 
the text of each hadeeth as it is found 
in the books of Sunnah; where a hadeeth 
has different wordings, I have chosen 
the version which best fits the fluency 
etc., but I have brought together other 
wordings thus: "(in one version: ... 
)" or "(in one narration: ...)". Only 
rarely have I given the Companion who 
narrated the hadeeth, or explained in 
the main text which of the Imaams of 
Hadeeth have collected each hadeeth, 
in order to provide easier reading and 
reference.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
As for the subsidiary text, it is a commentary 
on the main text. In it I have traced 
the ahaadeeth to their sources, exploring 
their various versions and routes of 
narration. Along with this, I have commented 
on their isnaads and supporting narrations, 
with authenticating and disparaging remarks 
on narrators, whether authentic or weak, 
judged according to the rules of the 
science of Hadeeth. Often, one route 
of narration has additional words which 
are not found in other routes, so I have 
inserted these into the original hadeeth 
in the main text whenever it is possible 
to do so without destroying the fluency, 
enclosing the addition in square brackets: 
[...], usually without stating which 
of the sources were alone in containing 
that addition. This has been done only 
if the hadeeth is originally on the authority 
of the same Companion, otherwise I have 
given it separately, e.g. in the opening 
supplications etc. This insertion of 
additional wordings is a tremendous advantage 
which you will not find in many books 
- Praise be to Allaah, by Whose Favour 
good actions are completed.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Next, I have mentioned in the subsidiary 
text the madhhabs of the scholars regarding 
the hadeeth traced, as well as the evidence 
and counter-evidence for each view, along 
with the strengths and weaknesses of 
each argument. We have then selected 
out of that the correct view which we 
have given in the main text. Also in 
the subsidiary text, we have given some 
issues for which there is no text in 
the Sunnah, but which require ijtihaad, 
and do not come under the title of this 
book.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Since the publication of this book with 
both main and subsidiary texts is not 
feasible right now due to various reasons, 
we have decided to publish only the main 
text of the book (along with brief footnotes) 
by Allaah's Will, and named it "Sifah 
Salaah an-Nabi (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa 
sallam), min at-takbeer ilaa at-tasleem 
ka'annaka taraahaa (The Prophet's Prayer 
Described, from beginning to end, as 
though you were watching it)".</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
I ask Allaah to make this work sincerely 
for His Face, and to help my brothers 
in faith to benefit from it, for He is 
the Hearer, the Answerer. </font><br>

<h2 align="left"><font size=+3> <a name="RTFToC3">Methodology 
of this Book </a></font></h2>
<div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 
the purpose of this book is to convey 
the guidance of the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) regarding Prayer, 
it was elementary that I would not limit 
myself to a particular Madhhab, for the 
reasons mentioned previously. Therefore, 
I would give whatever is authentically 
proved from him (sallallaahu 'alaihi 
wa sallam), as has always been the way 
of the scholars of Hadeeth<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn12"><sup>13</sup></a>, 
whether of old or of the recent past<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn13"><sup>14</sup></a>, 
as the excellent saying goes: </font> 
</div>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
The People of Hadeeth are the People 
of the Messenger, although They accompany 
him not, they are with his every movement.<a
href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn14"><sup>15</sup></a></font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Thus this book would, Allaah Willing, 
gather whatever is relevant to each topic 
from the various contents of the books 
of Hadeeth and the books on the differences 
between the Madhhabs, such that the correct 
verdicts found in this book would not 
be found totally in any one Madhhab. 
Hence the one acting on it, Allaah Willing, 
would be among those whom Allaah had 
guided <tt><b><i><font color="#339900" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"by 
His Grace to the Truth concerning that 
in which they differed, for Allaah guides 
whom He will to a path that is straight."</font></i></b></tt><a

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
When I adopted these principles for myself, 
i.e. to adhere to the authentic Sunnah, 
and to implement them in this book as 
well as others, I knew for sure that 
this would not satisfy every group of 
people or sect; in fact, it would result 
in some, if not most of them, insulting 
or criticising me. This does not matter 
to me, for I also know that to please 
everyone is an unattainable notion, and 
that <b>"He who pleases the people by 
angering Allaah, Allaah will entrust 
him to the people"</b>, as the Messenger 
of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 
said.<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn16"><sup>17</sup></a> 
The reward is with Allaah for the author 
of the following lines:</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Nor could I ever escape from abuse, Even 
were I in a cave in a rugged mountain; 
For who can escape from the people unharmed, 
Even if he hides behind the eagle's wings?</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
It is enough for me that I believe that 
this is the most upright way, which Allaah 
has commanded the believers to take; 
which our Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam), Chief of the Messengers, 
has explained. This is the path which 
was trodden by the Pious Predecessors: 
the Companions, their Successors and 
those after them, including the four 
Imaams to whose Madhhabs the majority 
of Muslims today attribute themselves. 
All of them were agreed on the obligation 
to stick to the Sunnah and to refer to 
it; to ignore every view contradictory 
to it, no matter how great the holder 
or propounder of that view, for the status 
of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) is far greater, and 
his example is far truer. Because of 
this, I have acted on their guidance, 
followed in their footsteps and carried 
out their commands to stick to the authentic 
hadeeth, even if this opposes their view. 
These commands of theirs have influenced 
me greatly in my perusal of this path, 
and my rejection of blind taqleed (following 
of opinion). I ask Allaah Exalted to 
reward them greatly. </font><br>

These are the clear, lucid sayings of 
the Imaams (Allaah Exalted be pleased 
with them) about sticking to the Hadeeth 
and forbidding the following of their 
opinion without clearly- visible evidence, 
such that mere opinion and interpretation 
is not acceptable.</font>

Hence, whoever adhered to whatever of 
the Sunnah that was proved authentic, 
even if it opposed some of the Imaams' 
sayings, he would not be conflicting 
with their madhhab, nor straying from 
their path; rather, such a person would 
be following all of them and would be 
grasping the most trustworthy hand-hold, 
which never breaks. However, this would 
not be the case with the one who abandoned 
any of the authentic Sunnah simply because 
it contradicted their views; nay, such 
a person would be being disobedient to

Haafiz Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (rahimahullaah) 
says:</font> 
<p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Therefore 
it is obligatory on anyone who hears 
of a command of the Messenger of Allaah 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) or knows 
it, to explain it to the Ummah, advise 
them sincerely, and order them to follow 
his command, even if it contradicts the 
opinion of someone great. This is because 
the authority of the Messenger of Allaah 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) has the 
most right to be respected and followed, 
over and above the opinion of anyone 
great who has unknowingly contradicted 
the Messenger's command in any matter. 
This is why the Companions and those 
after would refute anyone who contradicted 
the authentic Sunnah, sometimes being 
very stern in their refutation<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn50"><sup>51</sup></a>, 
not out of hatred for that person, for 
they loved and respected him, but because 
the Messenger of Allaah was more beloved 
to them, and his command was superior 
to the command of any other created being. 
Hence, when the order of the Messenger 
and that of someone else conflicted, 
the order of the Messenger would be more 
fitting to be enforced and followed. 
None of this would stop them respecting 
the person they had opposed because they 
knew that he would be forgiven<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn51"><sup>52</sup></a>; 
in fact, the latter would not mind his 
instruction being opposed when the command 
of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) was clearly shown 
to be opposite."<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn52"><sup>53</sup></a></font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Indeed, how could they mind that, when 
they had ordered their followers to do 
so, as we have seen, and had enjoined 
on them to abandon any of their views 
which contradicted the Sunnah. In fact, 
Imaam Shaafi'i (rahimahullaah) told his 
companions to attribute the authentic 
Sunnah to him also, even if he had not 
adopted it or had adopted something contradictory 
to it. Hence, when the analyst Ibn Daqeeq 
al-'Eid (rahimahullaah) collected together, 
in a bulky volume, the issues in which 
one or more of the four Imaams' madhhabs 
had contradicted the authentic hadeeth, 
he wrote at the beginning of it, "It 
is prohibited to attribute these answers 
to the Mujtahid Imaams, and obligatory 
on the jurists who follow their opinions 
to know of these so that they do not 
quote them regarding these and thus lie 
against them."<a

<h4 align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="RTFToC9">The 
Imaams' Followers Leaving their Views 
if these Contradicted the Sunnah </a></font></h4>
<div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due 
to all that we have mentioned, the disciples 
of the Imaams, a number of people from 
those of old, and a few from those of 
later time<a
href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn54"><sup>55</sup></a>, 
would not accept all of their Imaam's 
views; they actually ignored many when 
they found them to be clearly against 
the Sunnah. Even the two Imaams, Muhammad 
ibn al-Hasan and Abu Yoosuf (rahimahullaah) 
differed from their shaikh Abu Haneefah 
"in about a third of the Madhhab"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn55"><sup>56</sup></a>, 
as the books of masaa'il prove. Similarly 
is said about Imaam al- Muzani<a
href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn56"><sup>57</sup></a> 
and other followers of Shaafi'i and other 
Imaams; were we to start giving examples, 
the discussion would become exceedingly, 
long, and we would digress from what 
we set out to do in this Introduction, 
so we shall limit ourselves to two instances: 
</font> </div>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
1) Imaam Muhammad says in his Muwatta'<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn57"><sup>58</sup></a>(p. 
158), "As for Abu Haneefah, he did not 
regard there being a prayer to ask for 
rain, but we hold that the imaam prays 
two rak'ahs and then supplicates and 
holds out his wrapping garment ..."</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
2) We have 'Isaam ibn Yoosuf al-Balkhi, 
one of the companions of Imaam Muhammad<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn58"><sup>59</sup></a> 
and a servant of Imaam Abu Yoosuf<a
href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn59"><sup>60</sup></a>, 
who "would give verdicts contrary to 
Imaam Abu Haneefah because he did not 
know the latter's evidence, and other 
evidence would present itself to him, 
so he would give verdicts using that."<a
href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn60"><sup>61</sup></a> 
Hence, "he would raise his hands on bowing 
(in prayer) and on rising from it"<a href="/articles/salah/footnotes/01_fn.html#fn61"><sup>62</sup></a>, 
as is the mutawaatir sunnah of the Prophet 
(sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam); the 
fact that his three Imaams (i.e. Abu 
Haneefah, Abu Yoosuf and Muhammad) said 
otherwise did not prevent him from practising 
this sunnah. This is the approach which 
every Muslim is obliged to have, as we 
have already seen from the testimony 
of the Four Imaams, and others.</font> 
<p align="left"> 
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
To sum up: I sincerely hope that no follower 
of an Imaam will race to condemn the 
principles of this book and abandon benefiting 
from the sunnahs of the Prophet (sallallaahu 
'alaihi wa sallam) which it contains, 
with the argument that they are contrary 
to his Madhhab. I hope that such a person 
will instead consider what we have given 
of the exhortations of the Imaams towards 
the obligation to act on the Sunnah and 
ignore their sayings contradictory to 
it. I hope also that he will realise 
that to condemn the attitude of this 
book is to condemn whichever Imaam he 
is following, for we have taken these 
principles from those Imaams, as we have 
explained. Therefore, whoever refuses 
to be guided by them on this path is 
in great danger, for such refusal necessitates 
turning away from the Sunnah, the Sunnah 
to which we have been ordered to refer 
in cases of difference of opinion and 
on which we have been commanded to depend.</font>
