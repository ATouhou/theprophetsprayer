Hadeeth 2 only gives a part of the meaning 
of no. 1, i.e. the saying of aameen by 
the imaam alone. As for the aameen of 
those behind, this could be the reason 
for the phrase "the mosque trembled with 
it (the sound)", but the hadeeth literally 
implies that the aameen of the Prophet 
(sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) was the 
reason for this. </font><br>

All the above sources contain Ishaaq 
ibn Ibraaheem ibn al-`Alaa' az-Zubaidi, 
also known as Ibn Zibreeq, who is weak: 
Abu Haatim said, "An old man, no harm 
in him"; Ibn Ma`een described him in 
good terms; Nasaa'i said, "Not reliable"; 
Muhammad ibn `Awf said, "I have no doubt 
that Ishaaq ibn Zibreeq used to lie." 
However, this wording is correct in meaning, 
for it has a supporting hadeeth of Waa'il 
ibn Hajar with a saheeh sanad.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
(Since the text of this hadeeth does 
not imply the aameen of the congregation 
at all, it is incorrect to regard it 
as another version of hadeeth no. 2, 
as Shawkaani did.)</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
The only support for no. 1 is what Shaafi`i 
related in his Musnad (1/76) via Muslim 
ibn Khaalid from Ibn Juraij from `Ataa', 
who said: </font><br>

</center>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
has two defects: </font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
(i) The weakness of Muslim ibn Khaalid 
az-Zanji; Ibn Hajar said, "He was truthful, 
but made many errors."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
(ii) The `an`anah of Ibn Juraij, who 
was a mudallis; perhaps he actually took 
it from Khaalid ibn Abi Anoof, who narrated 
it from `Ataa' as follows:</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
4.1- "I came across two hundred Companions 
of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 
`alaihi wa sallam) in this mosque (i.e. 
Masjid al-Haraam, Makkah): when the imaam 
had said `Nor of those who go astray', 
they raised their voices in aameen (in 
one narration: I heard the thundering 
sound of their aameen)."</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Related by Baihaqi (2/59) &amp; Ibn Hibbaan 
in Thiqaat (2/74); the alternative narration 
is from the former.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
This Khaalid was described by Ibn Abi 
Haatim (1/2/355-6), but he did not include 
any authentication or disparagement. 
Ibn Hibbaan included him among the reliable 
narrators, but Ibn Hibbaan is well-known 
to be far from rigorous in such cases, 
so I am not satisfied that this narration 
is authentic. This is because if Ibn 
Juraij indeed took it from him, this 
constitutes only one debatable route; 
if not, we do not know from whom Ibn 
Juraij took it. It seems that Imaam Shaafi`i 
himself was not satisfied of the authenticity 
of this narration, for his position is 
contrary to it: he says in al-Umm (1/95), 
"So when the imaam completes reciting 
the Mother of the Book, he says 'aameen', 
raising his voice so that those behind 
may follow him: when he says it, they 
say it to themselves, but I do not like 
them saying it aloud"; had the above 
narration from the Companions been authentic 
in Shaafi`i's view, he would not have 
opposed their action.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Hence, the most correct opinion in this 
issue appears to be the madhhab of Shaafi`i: 
that the imaam, but not those following, 
should say `aameen' loudly. Allaah knows 
best.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
But then, I saw that Bukhaari mentioned 
the text (only) of the narration about 
Ibn az-Zubair in his Saheeh (i.e. in 
mu`allaq form), designating it with certainty. 
Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (2/208), 
"The connecting isnaad has been provided 
by `Abd ar-Razzaaq from Ibn Juraij from 
`Ataa'. He (i.e. Ibn Juraij) said, `I 
said to him, "Did Ibn az-Zubair say aameen 
at the end of the Mother of the Qur'aan 
?" He said, "Yes, and those behind him 
also said aameen, until the mosque echoed." 
He then said, "Verily, aameen is a supplication".'" 
This is found in the Musannaf of `Abd 
ar-Razzaaq (2640/2), and from this route, 
in Ibn Hazm's al-Muhallaa (3/364).</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
In this narration, Ibn Juraij has clarified 
that he took the narration from `Ataa' 
face-to-face, so we are assured of the 
absence of tadlees, and the narration 
of Ibn az-Zubair is established firmly. 
Similarly is proven from Abu Hurairah; 
Abu Raafi` said: </font><br>

<h2><font size=+3> <a name="RTFToC7"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Garamond" size="5" color="#336600">5- 
"Abu Hurairah used to call to prayer 
for Marwaan ibn al-Hakam, stipulating 
that the latter would not get to `Nor 
of those who go astray' unless he knew 
that Abu Hurairah had entered the row. 
So when Marwaan said `Nor of those 
who go astray', Abu Hurairah would 
say `aameen', prolonging it. He also 
said, `When the aameen of those on 
the earth coincides with the aameen 
of those in the heaven, they are forgiven'."</font> 
</a></font></h2>
</center>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Related 
by Baihaqi (2/59); its isnaad is saheeh. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
Hence, since nothing is established from 
any of the Companions other than Abu 
Hurairah and Ibn az-Zubair contrary to 
their aameen <b>aloud</b>, this must 
be accepted. Presently, I know of no 
narration opposing this. Allaah knows 
best.</font>
