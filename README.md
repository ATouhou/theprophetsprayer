# About
This repository is about converting Shaykh Al-Albani's book, "Sifat Salat an-Nabi" into more accessbile formats with good design.

# Aim
The aim is to convert the source mentioned below into markdown format which will then be used to create the respective PDF and HTML formats.

# Questions
1. But the book is already available on the website mentioned under 'Sources'?
  
  **Ans:** Yes that is correct. However, the site design is quite old, still using HTML tables for layout and all the Arabic sections are poor quality images; we hope to rectify these problems insha'Allah.

# Source Used
