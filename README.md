# Questions

1. But the book is already available on the website mentioned under 'Sources'?

  **Ans:** Yes that is correct. However, the site design is quite old, still using HTML tables for layout and all the Arabic sections are poor quality images; we hope to rectify these problems insha'Allah.

# Source Used
