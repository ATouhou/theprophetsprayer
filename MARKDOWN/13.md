The First Tashahhud\
 ![](/images/salah/iftirash.gif)
================================

\
 Next, he (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would sit for tashahhud after
finishing the second rak'ah. In a two-rak'ah prayer such as Fajr, "he
would sit
muftarishan"[^175^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn174), as he
used to sit between the two sajdahs, and "he would sit in the first
tashahhud similarly"[^176^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn175)
in a three- or four-rak'ah prayer. \[see diagram - qss\]

He also ordered "the one who prayed badly" thus, saying to him, **When
you sit in the middle of the prayer, then be calm, spread your left
thigh and perform
tashahhud.**[^177^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn176)

Abu Hurairah (radi Allāhu 'anhu) said, "My friend (sallAllāhu 'alaihi
wa sallam) forbade me from squatting (iq'aa') like a
dog"[^178^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn177); in another
hadeeth, "he used to forbid the squatting of the
devil."[^179^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn178)

"When he sat in tashahhud, he would place his right palm on his right
thigh (in one narration: knee), and his left palm on his left thigh (in
one narration: knee, spreading it upon
it)"[^180^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn179); and "he would
put the end of his right elbow on his right
thigh."[^181^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn180)

Also, "he forbade a man who was sitting in prayer resting on his left
hand, and said: **Verily, that is the prayer of the
Jews**[^182^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn181); in one
wording, **Do not sit like this, for indeed this is the way of sitting
of those who are
punished**[^183^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn182); in
another hadeeth, **It is the sitting posture of those who incurred
(Allāh's) anger.**[^184^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn183)\
\

Moving the Finger in Tashahhud
------------------------------

"He (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would spread his left palm on his
left knee, clench all the fingers of his right hand, point with the
finger adjacent to the thumb towards the qiblah, and fix his sight on it
(i.e. the finger)."[^185^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn184)

Also, "when he pointed with his finger, he would put his thumb on his
middle finger"[^186^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn185), and
sometimes "he would make a circle with these
two."[^187^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn186)

"When he raised his finger, he would move it, supplicating with
it"[^188^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn187), and he used to
say, "**It is surely more powerful against the devil than iron, meaning
the forefinger.**"[^189^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn188)

Also, "the Companions of the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam)
used to remind each other, that is, about pointing with the finger when
supplicating."[^190^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn189)

Once, "he saw a man supplicating with two fingers, so he said, "**Make
it one, \[make it one,\]**" and indicated with his
forefinger."[^191^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn190)

"He (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would do this in both
tashahhuds."[^192^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn191)\
\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\

The Obligation of the First Tashahhud, & theValidity of Supplication during it
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"He (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would recite the Tahiyyah after
every two rak'ahs"[^193^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn192);
"the first thing he would say in this sitting would be: **All
compliments be to
Allāh.**"[^194^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn193)

"When he forgot to perform the tashahhud after the first two rak'ahs, he
would prostrate (twice) for
forgetfulness."[^195^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn194)

He used to order them to perform tashahhud, saying, **When you sit after
every two rak'ahs, then say: All compliments ... and then each of you
should select the supplication he likes best and supplicate Allāh,
Mighty and Sublime, \[with
it\]**[^196^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn195); in another
version: **Say, All compliments ... in every
sitting**[^197^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn196), and he
also ordered "the one who prayed badly" to do so, as has been mentioned.

"He (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would teach them the tashahhud the
way he taught them Soorahs of the
Qur'aan"[^198^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn197), and "the
Sunnah is to say it
quietly."[^199^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn198)\
\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\

The Manner of Tashahhud
-----------------------

He taught several ways of tashahhud:

1.  The tashahhud of Ibn Mas'ood, who said, "The Messenger of Allāh
    (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) taught me the tashahhud, \[with\] my
    palm between his palms, the way he taught me Soorahs of the
    Qur'aan:\
    ![](/images/salah/671.gif)
    \
     **All
    compliments**[^200^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn199),
    **prayers**[^201^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn200) **and
    pure words**[^202^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn201)
    **are due to Allāh.
    Peace**[^203^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn202) **be on
    you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His
    blessings**[^204^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn203)**.
    Peace be on us, and on the righteous slaves of Allāh. \[For when
    one says that, it includes every righteous slave in the heaven and
    the earth.\] I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped
    except Allāh, and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His slave
    and messenger.**\
    \
     \[This was while he was among us, but after he was taken, we would
    say:\
    ![](/images/salah/672.gif)
    \
     \[Peace be on the
    Prophet\]."[^205^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn204)
2.  The tashahhud of Ibn 'Abbaas: "The Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu
    'alaihi wa sallam) used to teach us the tashahhud the way he taught
    us \[soorahs of\] the Qur'aan; he used to say,\
    ![](/images/salah/681.gif)
    \
     **All compliments, blessed words, prayers, pure words are due
    to Allāh. Peace be on you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh
    and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous slaves
    of Allāh. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped
    except Allāh, and \[I bear witness\] that Muḥammad is the Messenger
    of Allāh (**in one narration: **... is His slave
    and messenger).**"[^206^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn205)
3.  The tashahhud of Ibn 'Umar, who reported the Messenger of Allāh
    (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) as saying in the tashahhud:\
    ![](/images/salah/691.gif)
    \
     **All compliments, prayers and good words are due to Allāh. Peace
    be on you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh** - Ibn 'Umar
    said, "I
    add:"[^207^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn206) ... **and
    His blessings. - Peace be on us and on the righteous slaves
    of Allāh. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped
    except Allāh** - Ibn 'Umar said, "I
    add:"[^208^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn207) ...
    **alone, He has no partner, - and I bear witness that Muḥammad is
    His slave
    and messenger.**[^209^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn208)
4.  The tashahhud of Abu Moosaa al-Ash'ari, who said that the Messenger
    of Allāh (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said, ... when you are
    sitting, the first thing each of you says should be:\
    ![](/images/salah/692.gif)
    \
     **All compliments, good words and prayers are due to Allāh. Peace
    be on you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and
    His blessings. Peace be on us, and on the righteous slaves
    of Allāh. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped
    except Allāh \[alone, He has no partner\], and I bear witness that
    Muḥammad is His slave and messenger - seven phrases, and they are
    the greetings in
    the prayer.**"[^210^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn209)
5.  The tashahhud of 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab, who would teach the people
    the tashahhud while on the pulpit, saying, "Say:\
    ![](/images/salah/701.gif)
    \
     **All compliments are due to Allāh; all pure titles are due to
    Allāh; all good words \[are due to Allāh\]; all prayers are due
    to Allāh. Peace be on you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh

As-Salaah 'alaa an-Nabiyy(Sending Prayers on the Prophet) - Its Place & Manner
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) used to send prayers on himself in
the first tashahhud as well as the
other.[^212^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn211) He also
established it for his ummah, ordering them to send prayers on him after
sending peace on him[^213^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn212),
and he taught them several ways of doing so:

1.  \
    ![](/images/salah/711.gif)
    \
     **O Allāh! send prayers on
    Muḥammad**[^214^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn213)**, and
    on his household, and on his wives and progeny, as you sent prayers
    on the family of Ibraaheem; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full
    of Glory. And send blessings on
    Muḥammad**[^215^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn214)**, and
    his household, and his wives and progeny, as you sent blessings on
    the family of Ibraaheem; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of
    Glory.\

Important Notes about as-Salaah 'alaa an-Nabiyy - Sending Prayers on the Prophet of the Ummah
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1\) It can be seen that in most of these ways of sending prayers on the
Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam), there is no mention of
Ibraaheem separate from his family, the wording being, "... as you have
sent prayers on the family of Ibraaheem." The reason for this is that in
'Arabic, the family of a man includes the man as well as his dependants,
e.g. in the words of the Exalted,

"`Allāh  has chosen Aadam, Nooh, the family of  Ibraaheem and the family of 'Imraan above  all people`"
**(al-'Imraan 3:33)**;

"`We  sent against them a violent tornado with  showers of stones, except the family  of Loot - We delivered them by early  dawn`"
(Qamar 54:34); similar is his saying (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam),
**O Allāh! send prayers on the family of Abu Awfaa.** The phrase Ahl
al-Bayt (people of the house) is also like this, e.g.

"`Allāh's  grace and His blessings be on you, O  people of the house`"
(Houd 11:73). Hence, Ibraaheem is included in "the family of Ibraaheem".

Shaikh-ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah says,

> "Most of the versions have, 'as you sent prayers on the family of
> Ibraaheem' and 'as you sent blessings on the family of Ibraaheem';
> some have 'Ibraaheem' himself. This is because he is the cause of all
> prayers and purifications on them; the rest of his family are
> secondary recipients of all that. To show these two points, both
> wordings have been employed separately."

Further, there is a well-known question among the people of knowledge:
about the nature of the comparison in his statement, "as you sent
prayers on ...", for it is true that the model for comparison is
normally superior to the one being compared; here, the opposite is the
case, since Muḥammad (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) is greater than
Ibraaheem, and so his superiority dictates that the prayers requested
are more excellent than any prayers received or to be received by anyone
else. The people of knowledge have provided many answers to this, and
these can be found in Fath al-Baari and Jalaa' al-Ifhaam. They amount to
about ten views, all of which are unsubstantiated, some weaker than
others, except one, a well-supported view, and adopted by
Shaikh-ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim. This view is: "The
family of Ibraaheem includes many prophets; none like them is found in
the family of Muḥammad. Therefore, when prayers on the Prophet
(sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) and his family are sought similar to
that bestowed on Ibraaheem and his family, which includes prophets, the
family of Muḥammad receives out of that what is appropriate for them.
Since the family of Muḥammad does not reach the rank of the prophets,
the extra blessings and benefit given to the prophets, including
Ibraaheem, are left for Muḥammad (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam). Thus
he gains a distinguished position which others cannot reach."

Ibn al-Qayyim says,

> "This is the best of all the previous views: that Muḥammad
> (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) is one of the family of Ibraaheem; in
> fact, he is the best of the family of Ibraaheem, as 'Ali ibn Talhah
> has related from Ibn 'Abbaas (radi Allāhu 'anhu) about the saying of
> the Exalted,
> "***`Allāh  has chosen Aadam, Nooh, the family of  Ibraaheem and the family of 'Imraan above  all people`***"
> (aal-'Imraan 3:33); Ibn 'Abbaas said, "Muḥammad is among the family of
> Ibraaheem". This is text for the fact that if other prophets descended
> from Ibraaheem are included in his family, then the inclusion of the
> Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) is more fitting.
> Hence our saying, "... as you sent prayers on the family of
> Ibraaheem", includes the prayers sent on him and on the rest of the
> prophets descended from Ibraaheem. Allāh has then ordered us to
> specifically send prayers on Muḥammad and his family, as much as we
> send prayers on him, along with the rest of Ibraaheem's family
> generally. Therefore, the Prophet's family receives out of that what
> is appropriate for them, leaving all of the remainder to him
> (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam). There is no doubt that the total
> amount of prayers received by Ibraaheem's family, with the Messenger
> of Allāh (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) among them, is greater than
> that received by the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) alone.
> Therefore, what is sought for him is such a great favour, definitely
> superior than that sought for Ibraaheem. Hence, the nature of the
> comparison and its consistency become clear. The prayers sought for
> him with these words are greater than those requested any other way,
> since what is requested with the supplication is that it be as much as
> the model of comparison, and that the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa
> sallam) receive a large portion: the comparison dictates that what is
> requested is more than what was given to Ibraaheem and others. Thus,
> the excellence and nobility of Muḥammad (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa
> sallam), over and above Ibraaheem and his family, which includes many
> prophets, is evident, and is as he deserves. This sending of prayers
> on the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) becomes evidence for
> this excellence of his, and this is no more than he deserves. So, may
> Allāh send prayers on him and on his family, and send peace on them,
> many greetings of peace, and reward him from our supplications better
> than He has rewarded any prophet from his people. O Allāh! send
> prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent
> prayers on the family of Ibraaheem; You are indeed Worthy of Praise,
> Full of Glory. And send blessings on Muḥammad, and on the family of
> Muḥammad, as you sent blessings on the family of Ibraaheem; You are
> indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory."

2\) The reader will see that this part of the Prayer, with all its
different types, is always a sending of prayers on the family of the
Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam): on his wives and children as
well as himself. Therefore, it is neither from the Sunnah, nor carrying
out the Prophet's command, to leave it at "O Allāh! send prayers on
Muḥammad" only. Rather, one of these complete types of supplication must
be used, as is reported from his action (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam),
whether in the first or the last tashahhud. There is text about this
from Imaam Shaafi'i in al-Umm: "The tashahhud in the first and second
instance is the same thing; by 'tashahhud', I mean the bearing of
witness and the sending of prayers on the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi
wa sallam): neither will suffice without the other."

In fact, one of the most amazing things to arise from this age and its
intellectual anarchy is that one person, Muḥammad Is'aaf Nashaasheebi,
in his book al-Islām as-Saheeh ("The Correct Islām"), has the audacity
to reject the sending of prayers on the family of the Prophet
(sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) when sending prayers on him, despite it
being firmly established in the Saheehs of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, and
elsewhere, on the authority of several Companions, e.g. Ka'b ibn 'Ujrah,
Abu Humaid as-Saa'idi, Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri, Abu Mas'ood al-Ansaari, Abu
Hurairah and Talhah ibn 'Ubaidullaah! In their ahaadeeth, it is found
that they asked the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam), "How do we
send prayers on you?", so he taught them this way of doing so.
Nashaasheebi's argument for his view is that Allāh the Exalted did not
mention anyone else with the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) in
His saying:

"`O  you who believe! Send prayers on him,  and salute him with all respect.`"
(Ahzaab 33:56) He then goes on to say in his refutation that the
Companions asked him (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) that question
because the meaning of "salaah" was known to them as "supplication", so
they were asking: "How can we supplicate to you?"!

This is a clear deception, for their question was not about the meaning
of "salaah" on him, in which case he would have a point, but it was
about the manner of doing the salaah on him, as is found in the
narrations to which we have referred. Thus it all fits, for they asked
him about the way of doing it according to the Sharee'ah, something
which they could not possibly find out except from the guidance of the
All-Knowing, All-Wise, Giver of the Sharee'ah. Similarly, they could
also ask him about the way of performing the Salaah made obligatory by
words of the Exalted such as "`Establish  the Salaah (Prayer)`"; for
their knowledge of the literal meaning of "Salaah" could not remove
their need to ask about its manner according to the Sharee'ah, and this
is crystal clear.

As for Nashaasheebi's argument referred to, it is of no consequence, for
it is well-known among the Muslims that the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi
wa sallam) is the expounder of the words of the Lord of the Worlds, as
He says:

"`And  We have sent down to you the Message  that you may explain clearly to the people  what is sent for them`"
(Nahl 16:44). Hence, the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam)
explained the way of doing salaah on him, and it included mention of his
family, so it is compulsory to accept that from him, due to Allāh's
saying:

`So  take what the Messenger gives you` ****** (Hashr 59:7), and the
well-known authentic hadeeth, **Verily, I have been given the Qur'aan
and something similar to
it.**[^225^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn224)

I really wonder what Nashaasheebi and those taken in by his pompous
words would say if someone were to reject the tashahhud in prayer
altogether, or reject the menstruating woman's abstaining from prayer
and fasting, all with the argument that Allāh the Exalted did not
mention the tashahhud in the Qur'aan; He only mentioned bowing and
prostration, and He did not exempt a menstruating woman from prayer and
fasting in the Qur'aan!! So, do they agree with such arguments, which
are along the lines of his original one, or not? If they do, and we hope
not, then they have strayed far, far away from guidance, and have left
the mainstream of the Muslims; if they do not, then they are correct in
agreeing with us, and their reasons for rejecting those arguments are
exactly the same as our reasons for rejecting Nashaasheebi's original
pronouncement, which we have explained clearly.

Therefore beware, O Muslims, of attempting to understand the Qur'aan
without recourse to the Sunnah, for you will never be able to do that,
even if you were the
Seebawaih[^226^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn225) of the age,
the expert of the age in the 'Arabic language. Here is an example in
front of you, for this Nashaasheebi is one of the leading scholars of
the 'Arabic language of this period; you have seen how he has strayed,
after being deceived by his knowledge of the language, by not seeking
the aid of the Sunnah in understanding the Qur'aan; in fact he has
rejected this aid, as you know. There are many other examples of this -
there is not enough room here to mention them, but what we have
mentioned will suffice, and Allāh is the Granter of all capability.

3\) The reader will also see that in none of these types of salaah on the
Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) is there the word sayyid (chief,
leader). The later scholars have differed about the validity of its
inclusion in the Ibraaheemee salaah. Due to lack of space we will not go
into the details of that nor make mention of those who rejected its
validity in keeping with the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam)'s
complete teaching to his ummah when he instructed, "Say: O Allāh! send
prayers on Muḥammad ..." on being asked about the manner of salaah on
him, but we will quote the Haafidh Ibn Hajr al-'Asqalaani on this,
bearing in mind his position as one of the great Shaafi'i scholars of
both hadeeth and fiqh, for contradiction of this teaching of the Prophet
(sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) has become widespread among Shaafi'i
scholars!

Haafiz Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghuraabeeli (790- 835 AH),
a companion of Ibn Hajr, said, and I quote from his
manuscript[^227^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn226):

> He (i.e. Ibn Hajr), may Allāh benefit us with his life, was asked
> about the features of salaah on the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa
> sallam), whether during prayer or outside it, compulsory or
> recommended: Is one of its conditions that the Prophet (sallAllāhu
> 'alaihi wa sallam) be attributed with sayaadah (leadership), e.g. 'O
> Allāh! send prayers on sayyidinaa (our leader) Muḥammad ...' or 'the
> foremost of creation', or 'the leader of the children of Aadam' etc.?
> Or should one stick to 'O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad'? Which of
> these two is the better approach: including the word sayyid, due to it
> being an established attribute of the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa
> sallam), or leaving it out due to the absence of it in the narrations?
> He (Ibn Hajr), may Allāh be pleased with him, replied: "Yes, to

>  b) Again from 'Ali, that he used to say, "The prayers of Allāh, the

> of whatever glorifies You, O Lord of the Worlds, be on Muḥammad son of
> 'Abdullaah, Seal of the Prophets, Imaam of the Godfearers, ... etc."\
>  c) On the authority of 'Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood, that he used to say,
> "O Allāh! send Your prayers, Your blessings and Your mercy, on
> Muḥammad, Your slave and messenger, the imaam of goodness, the
> messenger of mercy, ..." etc.\
>  d) From al-Hasan al-Basri, that he used to say, "Whoever wants to

Ibn Hajr's view of the unacceptability of describing the Prophet
(sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) as sayyid during the salaah on him in
accordance with the Qur'aanic order, is also that of the Hanafi
scholars. It is the view which must be adhered to, for it is a true
indication of love for him, (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam);

"`Say:  If you do love Allāh, then follow me:  Allāh will love you.`"
(aal-'Imraan 3:31)

Because of this, Imaam Nawawi said in Rawdah at-Taalibeen (1/265), "The
most complete salaah on the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) is:
O Allāh! send your prayers on Muḥammad ..." etc., corresponding to type
no. 3 given, in which there is no mention of sayyid!

4\) It should be known that types nos. 1 and 4 are the ones which the
Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) taught his
Companions when they asked about the manner of salaah on him, so this
has been used as evidence that these are the best ways of doing the
salaah on him, for he would not choose anything for them or himself
except the best and noblest. Imaam Nawawi, as mentioned, endorsed (in
Rawdah at- Taalibeen) that if a man were to take an oath to do the best
possible salaah on the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam), this
could not be fulfilled except in these ways.

Subki has given another reason: whoever does salaah with those types has
made salaah on the Prophet (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) with
certainty, and whoever does so with other words is in doubt whether or
not he has performed the prayers as requested. This is because they
said, "How do we send prayers on you?" and he replied, "Say: ...", thus
defining their salaah on him as their saying such-and-such. This was
mentioned by Haitami in ad-Darr al-Mandood (25/2); he then said (27/1)
that the objective is achieved with all the types which have occurred in
authentic ahaadeeth.

5\) It should be known that it is not valid to combine all these way into
one way of salaah, and the same goes for the different tashahhuds given
previously. In fact, that would be an innovation in the religion; the
Sunnah is to say different ones at different times, as Shaikh-ul-Islām
Ibn Taymiyyah has explained in his discussion of the takbeers of the two
'Eids (Majmoo' al-Fataawaa 29/253/1).

6\) 'Allaamah Siddeeq Hasan Khaan says in his book Nuzul al- Abraar bil
'Ilm al-Ma'thoor min al-Ad'iyah wal-Adhkaar, after giving many ahaadeeth
about the excellence of repeated salaah on the Prophet (sallAllāhu
'alaihi wa sallam) (p. 161):

"There is no doubt that the foremost among the Muslims in sending salaah
on him (sall-Allāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) are the People of Hadeeth and
the narrators of the purified Sunnah, for it is one of their duties in
this noble branch of learning to make salaah on him before every
hadeeth, and so their tongues are always engaged in his mention, may
Allah grant him mercy and peace. There is no book of Sunnah or
collection of hadeeth, be it a jaami', musnad, mu'jam, juz', etc.,
except that it comprises thousands of ahaadeeth; even one of the least
bulky ones, Suyooti's al-Jaami' as-Sagheer, contains ten thousand
ahaadeeth, and the rest of the collections are no different. So this is
the Saved Sect: the body of the People of Hadeeth, who will be the
closest among men to the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa
sallam) on the Day of Resurrection, and the most likely to be rewarded
by his intercession (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam), may my mother and
father be sacrificed for him! This excellence of the People of Hadeeth
cannot be surpassed by anyone unless he does more than what they do,
something which is well-nigh impossible. Therefore, O desirer of good,
seeker of salvation, no matter what, you should either be a muhaddith,
or be close to the muhadditheen; do not be otherwise ... for apart from
that there is nothing which will benefit you."

I ask Allāh, Blessed and Exalted, to make me one of these People of
Hadeeth, who are the closest among men to the Messenger of Allāh
(sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam); perhaps this book will be a testimony
to that. May Allāh shower His mercy on Imaam Ahmad, who recited:

The religion of Muḥammad is in narrations,\
 The best mounts for a young man are the traditions;\
 Turn not away from Hadeeth and its people,\
 For Opinion is night, while Hadeeth is day,\
 A young man can be ignorant of the guidance ...\
 Although the sun is shining in all its splendour !\

Du'aa' in the First Tashahhud
-----------------------------

He (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) also set the guidance of du'aa in
this tashahhud as well, saying, **When you sit after every two rak'ahs,
then say: All compliments are due to Allāh ...** (till the end of that
supplication, and then said:) ... **then he should select of the
supplications what is most pleasing to
him.**[^228^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn227)\
\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\

Standing up for the Third, and then the Fourth, Rak'ah
------------------------------------------------------

Next, he (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would get up for the third
rak'ah with takbeer[^229^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn228),
and he ordered "the one who prayed badly" to do so: Then do that in
every rak'ah, as before.

"When he (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) stood from the sitting
position, he would say takbeer, and then stand
up"[^230^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn229); and "he
(sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would raise his
hands"[^231^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn230) with this
takbeer sometimes.

"When he wanted to stand up for the fourth rak'ah, he would say: Allāh
is the Greatest"[^232^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn231), and
he ordered "the one who prayed badly" likewise, as before, and "he
(sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would raise his
hands"[^233^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn232) with this
takbeer sometimes.

"He would sit up straight on his left foot, at ease, until every bone
returned to its proper place, then stand up, supporting himself on the
ground; and he would clench his
fists[^234^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn233): supporting
himself with his hands when standing
up."[^235^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn234)

He would recite al-Faatihah in both these rak'ahs, and he ordered "the
one who prayed badly" to do that. In Zuhr prayer, he would sometimes add
a few aayaat to this, as has been explained under "Recitation in Zuhr
Prayer".\

Qunoot in the Five Prayers because of a Calamity
------------------------------------------------

"When he (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) wanted to supplicate against
someone, or supplicate for someone, he would perform
qunoot[^236^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn235) in the last
rak'ah, after rukoo'; after having said: Allāh listens to the one who
praises Him.[^237^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn236) "He
would supplicate
loudly"[^238^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn237), "raise his
hands"[^239^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn238), and "those
behind him would say:
aameen"[^240^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn239).

"He was known to perform qunoot in all five
prayers"[^241^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn240), although
"he would only perform qunoot in them when he supplicated for a people
or supplicated against a
people"[^242^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn241). For example,
he once said, **O Allāh! rescue al-Waleed ibn al- Waleed, and Salamah
ibn Hishaam, and 'Ayyaash ibn Abi Rabee'ah. O Allāh! harden Your
penalty on (the tribe of) Mudar, and cause for it years (of famine) like
the years of Yoosuf. \[O Allāh! curse Lahyaan, and Ru'l, and Dhakwaan,
and 'Usayyah, who disobeyed Allāh and His
Messenger!\]**[^243^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn242)

Then, "he would say: **Allāh is the Greatest** when he had finished
qunoot and
prostrate."[^244^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn243)\
\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\

Qunoot in Witr Prayer
---------------------

"He (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) used to perform qunoot in the (odd)
rak'ah of the Witr
prayer"[^245^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn244)
sometimes[^246^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn245), and "he
would perform it before
rukoo'."[^247^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn246)

He taught al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (radi Allāhu 'anhu) to say \[after
finishing his recitation in Witr\]:

![](/images/salah/841.gif)

"**O Allāh! guide me among those whom You have guided; and pardon me
among those who You have pardoned; and turn on me in friendship among
those on whom You have turned in friendship; and bless me in what You
have bestowed; and save me from the evil of what You have decreed;
\[for\] indeed You decree, and none can influence You; \[and\] he is not
humiliated whom You have befriended; \[nor is he honoured who is Your
enemy.\] Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted. \[There is no place of
safety from You except towards
You.\]**"[^248^](/articles/salah/footnotes/13_fn.html#fn247)
