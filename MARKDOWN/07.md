## To Look at the Place of Prostration, and Humility

"He \pbuh used to incline his head during prayer and fix his sight towards the ground"[^81] -- "while he was in the Kaʿbah, his sight did not leave the place of his prostration until he came out from it";[^82] and he said, "It is not fitting that there should be anything in the house which disturbs the person praying."[^83]

"He used to forbid looking up at the sky,"[^84] and he emphasised this prohibition so much that he said: "People must refrain from looking up at the sky in prayer, or their sight will not return to them (and in one narration: or their sight will be plucked away)."[^85] In another ḥadīth: "So when you pray, do not look here and there, for Allāh sets His Face for the face of his slave in his prayer as long as he does not look away,"[^86] and he also said about looking here and there, "it is a snatching away which the devil steals from the slave during prayer."[^87]

He \pbuh also said: "Allāh does not cease to turn to a slave in his prayer as long as he is not looking around; when he turns his face away, Allāh turns away from him[^88];" he "forbade three things: pecking like a hen, squatting (iq'aa'), like a dog and looking around like a fox[^89];" he also used to say, "Pray a farewell prayer as if you see Him, but if you do not see Him, surely He sees you;"[^90] and, "Any person who, when an obligatory prayer is due, excels in its ablution, humility and bowings, will have it as a remission for his previous minor sins as long as he does not commit a major sin, and this (opportunity) is for all times."[^91]

Once he \pbuh, prayed in a khamīsah[^92] and (during the prayer) he looked at its marks. So when he finished, he said: "Take this khamīsah of mine to Abū Jahm and bring me his anbijāniyyah,[^93] for it has diverted my attention from the prayer (in one narration: for I have looked at its marks during the prayer and it almost put me to trial)."[^94] Also "ʿĀʾishah had a cloth with pictures spread towards a sahwah,[^95] towards which the Prophet \pbuh prayed and then said: "Take it away from me [for its pictures did not cease to thwart me in my prayer].[^96]

He would also say: "Prayer is not valid when the food has been served, nor when it is time to relieve oneself of the two filths."[^97]
