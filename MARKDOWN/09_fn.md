By "poetry" here is meant the vain kind, for the Prophet \pbuh said: "Truly, some poetry is wisdom (al--Bukhārī)."

[^124]: Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Mājah, al--Dāraquṭnī and Ḥākim who, along with Ibn Ḥibbān and al--Dhahabī, declared it ṣaḥīḥ. It is given along with the next one in _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (342).

Abū ʿAmr al--Dānī transmitted it in _al--Muktafā_ (5/2) and said: "This ḥadīth has many routes, and it is what is depended upon in this regard, and several of the past imāms and reciters preferred to stop at every verse, even if some were connected (in meaning) to the one after." I say: This is a sunnah which has been neglected by the majority of the reciters of this age, let alone others.

[^134]: Bājī said: "He is referring to the saying of the Exalted 'And We have bestowed upon you seven of the Oft-Repeated and the Grand Recitation. (Sūrah al--Ḥijr, 15:87).' It is named the 'seven' because it has seven verses, and 'oft-repeated' because it is repeated again and again in prayer. It has been called 'the grand recitation' to specify this name for it, even though every part of the Qurʾān is a grand recitation; similarly, the Kaʿbah is 'the House of Allāh' even though all houses belong to Allāh; this is by way of specifying it and emphasising its importance."

Ibn ʿAbd al--Barr says in _al--Tamhīd_ (7/13), "It is the view of the majority of the Muslims, including Mālik as the people of Madīnah report from him, for it is authentic from Allāh's Messenger \pbuh through the aḥādīth of Abū Hurayrah (i.e. this one) and that of Wāʾil ibn Ḥujr (i.e. the previous one)."

    [NB]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: The āmīn of the congregation behind the imām should be done loudly and simultaneously with the imām, not before him as the majority of worshippers do, nor after him. This is what I finally find most convincing, as I have explained in some of my works, among them _Silsilah al--Aḥādīth al--Ḍaʿīfah_ (vol.\ 2, no.\ 952) which has been printed and published by the grace of Allāh, and _Ṣaḥīḥ al--Targhīb wa al--Tarhīb_ (1/205). See Appendix 6.

[^153]: Aḥmad with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād; the other ḥadīth was transmitted by Ibn Abī Dāwūd in _al--Masāhif_ (4/14/2). This and other similar aḥādīth contain permission for infants to enter the mosque. As for the ḥadīth on many lips: "Keep your small children away from your mosques...," it is ḍaʿīf and cannot be used for proof at all; among those who have declared it ḍaʿīf are Ibn al--Jawzī, Mundhirī, Haytamī, Ibn Ḥajar al--ʿAsqalānī and Būsayrī. ʿAbd al--Ḥaqq al--Ishbīli said, "It is baseless."

[^157]: Ibn Naṣr and al--Ṭaḥāwī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād; I take the meaning of the ḥadīth as: Make every rakʿah have a complete sūrah. The order is one of preference, not compulsion, from the evidence which follows.

[^165]: al--Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^166]: The first number is that of the sūrah, while the second is the number of āyāt in the sūrah. By inspecting the first of the two numbers in each case, it is easy to see that in many of these combinations, he \pbuh did not stick to the Qurʾānic order of the sūrahs, so this is evidence for the permissibility of doing this, even though it is better to follow the sequence of the Qurʾān. A similar case is to be found later under "Night prayer."

[^171]: Ibn Khuzaymah in his ṣaḥīḥ (1634) and Bayhaqī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. It has a supporting narration in Abū Dāwūd (no. 758, _Ṣaḥīḥ Abī Dāwūd_) and the basic story is in al--Bukhārī and Muslim. The first addition is in one narration of Muslim, the second in Aḥmad (5/74), and the third and fourth in al--Bukhārī. Also under this heading is the ḥadīth on the authority of Ibn ʿAbbās: "that the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh prayed two rakʿahs in which he recited only al--Fātiḥah," transmitted by Aḥmad (1/282), Hārith ibn Abī Usāmah in his musnad (p.\ 38 of its zawāʾid) and Bayhaqī (2/62) with a ḍaʿīf isnād. I used to declare this ḥadīth ḥasan in previous works, until I realised that I had been mistaken, because this ḥadīth depends on Hanzalah al--Dawsī, who is ḍaʿīf, and I do not know how this was unknown to me; maybe I thought he was someone else. Anyway, praise is due to Allāh who guided me to recognise my mistake, and that is why I hurried to correct it in print. Then Allāh compensated me with this better ḥadīth of Muʿādh which relates to what the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿAbbās indicated. Praise be to Allāh by whose Grace good actions are completed.

    "As for voluntary prayers during the day, there is nothing authentic from him \pbuh regarding either quiet or loud recitation, but it would seem that he used to recite quietly during them. It is reported from him \pbuh that once, during the daytime, he passed by ʿAbd Allāh ibn Hudhayfah who was praying and reciting loudly, so he said to him: 'O ʿAbd Allāh, let Allāh hear, not us.' But this ḥadīth is not strong."

The ḥadīth contains evidence that reciting more than al-Faatihah in the last two rakahs is a sunnah, and many Companions did so, among them Abu Bakr Siddeeq (may Allāh be pleased with him). It is also the view of Imaam Shaafii, whether in Zuhr or others, and of our later scholars, Abul Hasanaat al-Lucknowi took it in Notes on Muḥammad's  al-Muwatta' (p. 102) and said:

    "Some of our companions take hold a very strange view in obligating a sajdah sahw (prostration for forgetfulness) for the recitation of a soorah in the last two rakahs, but the commentators on al-Maniyyah, Ibraaheem al-Halabi, Ibn Ameer Haajj and others, have refuted this view extremely well. There is no doubt that those who said this were unaware of the hadeeth, and had it reached them they would not have said so."

	"This is the zeal/fervour of the Muslims in their actions which bring them nearer to their Lord. However they are bound to fall short and leave some actions (which they began due to this zeal) so the most beloved of their actions to Allāh's Messenger (sallAllāhu alaihi wa sallam) were those done otherwise (and kept up), so he ordered them to carry out righteous deeds which they are able to do continually and keep to until they meet their Lord-the Mighty and Majestic. It is narrated from him (sallAllāhu alaihi wa sallam) to clarify this that he said: "**The actions most loved by Allāh are those which are the most regular, even if they are little.**"

	I say: this hadeeth which he prefixes with the words "it is narrated" is saheeh, agreed upon by Bukhaari & Muslim from the narration of Aa'ishah (Allāh be pleased with her).

[^263]: Ahmad & Abu Daawood with a saheeh isnaad.

[^264]: Muslim & Abu Daawood. This hadeeth and others make it disliked (makrooh) to stay awake the whole night, whether always or regularly, for it is against the example of the Prophet (sallAllāhu alaihi wa sallam); for if staying up the whole night were better, he (sallAllāhu alaihi wa sallam) would have done so, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad. So do not be deceived by what is narrated from Abu Haneefah (rahimahullaah) that he prayed Fajr with the ablution of Ishaa' for forty years!! (translator's note: see Tablighi Nisab: Virtues of Salaat  by Maulana Zakariyya Kandhalvi for examples of this type of claim) For this narration from him is totally baseless; in fact Allaamah al-Fairoozaabaadi says in  Ar-Radd alaa al-Mutarid ( (44/1):

	>"This narration is a clear lie and cannot be attributed to the Imaam, for there is nothing excellent about it, whereas it was the nature of the likes of the Imaam to do the better thing; there is no doubt that the renewal of purification for each prayer is more excellent, most complete, and best. This is even if it is correct that he stayed awake the length of the night for forty consecutive years! This story seems more like a fairy tale, and is an invention of some of the extremely ignorant fanatics, who say it about Abu Haneefah and others, and all of it is lies."

[^271]: The evidence for these two rakahs is found in Saheeh Muslim and others as a practice of the Prophet (sallAllāhu alaihi wa sallam), but they oppose his saying: Make the last of your prayer  at night odd (witr) transmitted by Bukhaari and Muslim. The scholars have differed in reconciling these two hadeeth, none of them being convincing to me, so the most cautious thing is to leave the two rakahs in compliance with the command of the Prophet (sallAllāhu alaihi wa sallam). Allāh knows best.

	Later I came across an authentic hadeeth which had a command for two rakahs after witr, so the order of the Prophet (sallAllāhu alaihi wa sallam) agrees with his action, and the two rakahs are validated for everyone; the first command is thus one of recommendation, not negating the two rakahs. The latter hadeeth is given in Silsilat al-ahaadeeth as-saheehah (1993) - see Appendix 7.

[^a1]: Ibn al-Mubaarak in az-Zuhd (162/1 from al-Kawaakib 575), Abu Daawood & Ahmad with a saheeh isnaad.

[^a2]: Muslim & Maalik.

[^a3]: Abu Daawood & Tirmidhi, who declared it saheeh.

[^a8]: Bukhaari & Muslim.

[^a9]: ibid. Ibn Hajar said in his commentary on"aaa (| | |)", "this is a hamzah with a fathah, followed by a silent alif, followed by another hamzah." Shaikh Ali al-Qaari quoted likewise from others and then said: "It is obvious that this is three prolonged alifs."

[^a10]: Bukhaari as taleeq, Abu Daawood, Darimi, Haakim and Tammaam al-Raazi with two saheeh isnaads.

	**NOTE:** This hadeeth was turned round by one of the narrators, who narrated it as "beautify your voices with the Qur'aan". This is a mistake in narration and understanding, and whoever declared it saheeh is submerged in error, for it contradicts the authentic explanatory narrations in this section. In fact, it is a prime example of a maqloob hadeeth, and the details of this brief note are in  Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth  ad-Daeefah  (no. 5328).

[^a11]: A saheeh hadeeth transmitted by Ibn al Mubarak in az-Zuhd (162/1 from al-Kawaakib 575), Daarimi, Ibn Nasr, Tabaraani, Abu Nuaim in Akhbaar  Isbahaan and Diyaa' in al-Mukhtaarah.

[^a13]: Abu Daawood and Haakim who declared it saheeh and Dhahabi agreed.

[^a14]: Mundhiri said, "taghannnaa does mean to recite in a pleasant voice; Sufyaan bin Uyainah and others took the the view that it is to do with istighnaa (i.e. letting the Qur'aan make one dispense with worldly pleasures), but this is rejected."

[^a15]: Bukhaari, Muslim, Tahaawi & Ibn Mandah in Tawheed (81/1).

[^a16]: The scholars have said that musical instruments here means a beautiful voice and that the family of Daawood refers to Daawood himself; the family of so-and-so can be specifically for so-and-so only; Daawood (alaihis salaam) had an extremely beautiful voice. This is mentioned by Nawawi in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim.

[^a17]: Abdur Razzaaq in al-Amaali (2/44/1), Bukhaari, Muslim, Ibn Nasr and Haakim.

[^a18]: Abu Daawood, Ibn Hibbaan, Tabaraani, Ibn Asaakir (2/296/2) & Diyaa' in al-Mukhtaarah with a saheeh isnaad.
