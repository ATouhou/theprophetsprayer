[^123]: The three Arabic words _hamz_, _nafkh_, and _nafth_, were interpreted such by the narrator; all three interpretations are also traced back to the Prophet \pbuh with a _ṣaḥīḥ mursal isnād_. By “poetry”, what is meant is the vain kind, for the Prophet \pbuh said: “Truly, some poetry is wisdom.” (Al-Bukhārī)

[^124]: Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Mājah, al-Dāraquṭnī and al-Ḥākim who, along with Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Dhahabī, declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_. It is given along with the next one in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#342).

Abū ʿAmr al-Dānī transmitted it in _al-Muktafā_ (5/2) and said: “This _ḥadīth_ has many routes, and it is what is depended upon in this regard, and several of the past Imams and reciters preferred to stop at every verse, even if some were connected (in meaning) to the one after.” I say: This is a _sunnah_ which has been neglected by the majority of the reciters of this age, let alone others.

[^134]: Bājī said: “He is referring to the saying of the Exalted ‘And We have bestowed upon you seven of the Oft-Repeated and the Grand Recitation.’ (Sūrah al-Ḥijr, 15:87). It is named the ‘seven’ because it has seven verses, and ‘oft-repeated’ because it is repeated again and again in prayer. It has been called ‘the grand recitation’ to specify this name for it, even though every part of the Qurʾān is a grand recitation; similarly, the _Kaʿbah_ is ‘the House of Allāh’ even though all houses belong to Allāh; this is by way of specifying it and emphasizing its importance.”

[^143]: Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/97/1), al-Dāraquṭnī, Ibn Mājah, al-Ṭaḥāwī and Aḥmad from numerous routes, _musnad_ and _mursal_. Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah declared it strong, as in _al-Furūʿ_ of Ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī (48/2). Būṣayrī declared some of its _isnāds ṣaḥīḥ_. I have discussed it in detail and investigated its routes of narration in the manuscript version and then in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#500).

    [NB]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: The view of the validity of recitation behind the Imam in quiet but not loud prayers was taken by Imām al-Shāfiʿī initially, and by Muḥammad the student of Abū Ḥanīfah in a narration from him which was preferred by Shaykh ʿAlī al-Qārī and other _shaykhs_ of the _madhhab_; it was also the position of, among others, the Imāms Zuhri, Mālik, Ibn al-Mubārak, Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal, several of the _muḥaddithīn_, and it is the preference of Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah.

    [NB]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: The _āmīn_ of the congregation behind the Imam should be done loudly and simultaneously with the Imam, not before him as the majority of worshipers do, nor after him. This is what I finally find most convincing, as I have explained in some of my works, among them _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah_ (vol.\ 2, #952) which has been printed and published by the grace of Allāh, and _Ṣaḥīḥ al-Targhīb wa al-Tarhīb_ (1/205). See Appendix 6.

[^153]: Aḥmad with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_; the other _ḥadīth_ was transmitted by Ibn Abī Dāwūd in _al-Masāhif_ (4/14/2). This and other similar _aḥādīth_ contain permission for infants to enter the mosque. As for the _ḥadīth_ on many lips: “Keep your small children away from your mosques...,” it is _ḍaʿīf_ and cannot be used for proof at all; among those who have declared it _ḍaʿīf_ are Ibn al-Jawzī, Mundhirī, Haytamī, Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī and Būṣayrī. ʿAbd al-Ḥaqq al-Ishbīli said, “It is baseless.”

[^156]: Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/100/1), Aḥmad, and ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-Maqdisī in his _Sunan_ (9/2) with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_.

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

[^157]: Ibn Naṣr and al-Ṭaḥāwī with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_; I take the meaning of the _ḥadīth_: “Make every _rakʿah_ have a complete _sūrah_.” The order is one of preference, not compulsion, from the evidence which follows.

<!-- TODO fix link to appropriate section -->

[^158]: Aḥmad and Abū Yaʿlā from two routes. Also see _Recitation in Fajr prayer_.

[^159]: As he did in Fajr, as will follow.

[^160]: Details and sources will follow shortly.

[^161]: i.e. a _sūrah_ after Sūrah al-Fātiḥah.

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

[^162]: Al-Bukhārī as _taʿlīq_ and al-Tirmidhī as _mawsūl_, and he declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_.

[^163]: _nazāʾir_: _sūrahs_ which are similar in meaning, e.g. they both contain advice, commandments, or stories.

[^164]: These are agreed to end at the end of the Qurʾān; the soundest view is that they begin with Sūrah Qāf.

[^165]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

<!-- TODO fix link to section -->

[^166]: The first number is that of the _sūrah_, while the second is the number of _āyāt_ in the _sūrah_. By inspecting the first of the two numbers in each case, it is easy to see that in many of these combinations, he \pbuh did not stick to the Qurʾānic order of the _sūrahs_, so this is evidence for the permissibility of doing this, even though it is better to follow the sequence of the Qurʾān. A similar case is to be found later under _Night prayer_.

[^167]: Muslim and al-Ṭaḥāwī.

[^168]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Bayhaqī with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_. This _ḥadīth_ is general, so it applies to both recitation during prayer, whether voluntary or obligatory, and outside it. Ibn Abī Shaybah (2/132/2) has transmitted from Abū Mūsā al-ʿAsharī and Mughīrah ibn Shuʿbah that they used to say this in obligatory prayers, and from ʿUmar and ʿAlī without such specification.

[^169]: In the original, “the young man said.”

[^170]: _dandanah_: when someone speaks some words such that their intonation is audible but they cannot be understood; it is a little bit more than murmuring. (_Nihāyah_)

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

[^171]: Ibn Khuzaymah in his _Ṣaḥīḥ_ (1634) and al-Bayhaqī with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_. It has a supporting narration in Abū Dāwūd (#758, _Ṣaḥīḥ Abī Dāwūd_) and the basic story is in al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The first addition is in one narration of Muslim, the second in Aḥmad (5/74), and the third and fourth in al-Bukhārī. Also under this heading is the _ḥadīth_ on the authority of Ibn ʿAbbās: “that the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh prayed two _rakʿahs_ in which he recited only al-Fātiḥah,” transmitted by Aḥmad (1/282), Hārith ibn Abī Usāmah in his _Musnad_ (p.\ 38 of its _Zawāʾid_) and al-Bayhaqī (2/62) with a _ḍaʿīf isnād_. I used to declare this _ḥadīth ḥasan_ in previous works, until I realized that I had been mistaken, because this _ḥadīth_ depends on Hanzalah al-Dawsī, who is _ḍaʿīf_, and I do not know how this was unknown to me; maybe I thought he was someone else. Anyway, praise is due to Allāh who guided me to recognize my mistake, and that is why I hurried to correct it in print. Then Allāh compensated me with this better _ḥadīth_ of Muʿādh which relates to what the _ḥadīth_ of Ibn ʿAbbās indicated. Praise be to Allāh by whose Grace good actions are completed.

[^172]: There is _ijmāʾ_ (consensus of opinion) of the Muslims on this, with successors passing it on from the predecessors, along with authentic _aḥādīth_ which establish this, as al-Nawawī has said, and some of them follow. See also _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#345).

[^178]: ʿAbd al-Ḥaqq said in Tahajjud (90/1):

    “As for voluntary prayers during the day, there is nothing authentic from him \pbuh regarding either quiet or loud recitation, but it would seem that he used to recite quietly during them. It is reported from him \pbuh that once, during the daytime, he passed by ʿAbd Allāh ibn Hudhayfah who was praying and reciting loudly, so he said to him: ‘O ʿAbd Allāh, let Allāh hear, not us.’ But this _ḥadīth_ is not strong.”

[^179]: Muslim and al-Bukhārī in _Afʿāl al-ʿIbād_.

[^180]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Tirmidhī in _Shamāʾil_ with a _ḥasan isnād_. The _ḥadīth_ means that he \pbuh used to moderate between quietness and loudness.

[^181]: Al-Nasāʾī, al-Tirmidhī in _Shamāʾil_ and al-Bayhaqī in _Dalāʾil_ with a _ḥasan isnād_.

[^216]: Aḥmad and Muslim. The _ḥadīth_ contains evidence that reciting more than al-Fātiḥah in the last two _rakʿahs_ is a _sunnah_, and many Companions did so, among them Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq. It is also the view of Imām al-Shāfiʿī, whether in Ẓuhr or others, and of our later scholars, Abū al-Ḥasanāt al-Lucknowī took it in _Notes on Muḥammad's al-Muwaṭṭā_ (p.\ 102) and said:

    “Some of our companions take hold a very strange view in obligating a _sajdah sahw_ (prostration for forgetfulness) for the recitation of a _sūrah_ in the last two _rakʿahs_, but the commentators on _al-Maniyyah_, Ibrāhīm al-Ḥalabī, Ibn Amīr Ḥājj and others, have refuted this view extremely well.

[^255]: Arabic _shirrah_: excitement, enthusiasm, keenness, energy. The _shirrah_ of youth is his its beginning and its fervour/zeal. Imām al-Ṭaḥāwī says:

    "This is the zeal/fervour of the Muslims in their actions which bring them nearer to their Lord. However they are bound to fall short and leave some actions (which they began due to this zeal) so the most beloved of their actions to Allāh's Messenger \pbuh were those done otherwise (and kept up), so he ordered them to carry out righteous deeds which they are able to do continually and keep to until they meet their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. It is narrated from him \pbuh to clarify this that he said: 'The actions most loved by Allāh are those which are the most regular, even if they are little.'"

    I say: this ḥadīth which he prefixes with the words "it is narrated" is ṣaḥīḥ, agreed upon by al-Bukhārī and Muslim from the narration of ʿĀʾishah.

This ḥadīth and others make it disliked (makrūh) to stay awake the whole night, whether always or regularly, for it is against the example of the Prophet \pbuh; for if staying up the whole night were better, he \pbuh would have done so, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad. So do not be deceived by what is narrated from Abū Ḥanīfah that he prayed Fajr with the ablution of ʿIshāʾ for forty years! (translator's note: see _Tablighī Nisāb: Virtues of Salāh_ by Mawlānā Zakariyya Kandhalvi for examples of this type of claim) For this narration from him is totally baseless; in fact ʿAllāmah al-Fayrūzʿābādī says in _al-Radd ʿalā al-Mutarid_ (44/1):

    "This narration is a clear lie and cannot be attributed to the Imām, for there is nothing excellent about it, whereas it was the nature of the likes of the Imām to do the better thing; there is no doubt that the renewal of purification for each prayer is more excellent, most complete, and best. This is even if it is correct that he stayed awake the length of the night for forty consecutive years! This story seems more like a fairy tale, and is an invention of some of the extremely ignorant fanatics, who say it about Abū Ḥanīfah and others, and all of it is lies."

The scholars have differed in reconciling these two ḥadīth, none of them being convincing to me, so the most cautious thing is to leave the two rakahs in compliance with the command of the Prophet \pbuh. Allāh knows best.

    Later I came across an authentic ḥadīth which had a command for two rakʿahs after witr, so the order of the Prophet \pbuh agrees with his action, and the two rakʿahs are validated for everyone; the first command is thus one of recommendation, not negating the two rakʿahs. The latter ḥadīth is given in _Silsilah al-aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (1993)---see Appendix 7.

[^272]: Aḥmad and Ibn Naṣr and al-Ṭaḥāwī (1/202) and Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Ḥibbān with a ḥasan ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^278]: This is the saying of Imām al-Shāfiʿī, Aḥmad and Isḥāq, and some of the later Ḥanafīs who researched, took this view. As for the recitation of a sūrah after it, this is the view of some of the Shāfiʿīs and it is the correct view.

[^279]: Al-Bukhārī, Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī and Ibn al-Jārūd. The addition is not shādh (odd) as Tuwayjirī thinks.

[^c7]: _tarjī_: explained as a vibrating tone by Ibn Ḥajar; Manāwī said: "It arises from a feeling of joy and happiness, which he \pbuh felt a good deal on the day of the conquest of Makkah."

[^c8]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

<!-- TODO double check the following, especially the arabic part -->

[^c9]: Ibid. Ibn Ḥajar said in his commentary on "aaa (| | |)," "this is a hamzah with a fatḥah, followed by a silent alif, followed by another hamzah." Shaykh Alī al-Qārī quoted likewise from others and then said: "It is obvious that this is three prolonged alifs."

[^c10]: Al-Bukhārī as taʿlīq, Abū Dāwūd, Dārimī, al-Ḥākim and Tammām al-Rāzī with two ṣaḥīḥ isnāds.

    [NOTE]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: This ḥadīth was turned round by one of the narrators, who narrated it as "beautify your voices with the Qurʾān". This is a mistake in narration and understanding, and whoever declared it ṣaḥīḥ is submerged in error, for it contradicts the authentic explanatory narrations in this section. In fact, it is a prime example of a maqlūb ḥadīth, and the details of this brief note are in _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah_ (no.\ 5328).

[^c14]: Mundhirī said, "_taghannā_ does mean to recite in a pleasant voice; Sufyān bin Uyaynah and others took the the view that it is to do with _istighnā_ (i.e. letting the Qurʾān make one dispense with worldly pleasures), but this is rejected."

[^c15]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, al-Ṭaḥāwī and Ibn Mandah in _Tawḥīd_ (81/1).

[^c16]: The scholars have said that musical instruments here means a beautiful voice and that the family of Dāwūd refers to Dāwūd himself; the family of so-and-so can be specifically for so-and-so only; Dāwūd had an extremely beautiful voice. This is mentioned by al-Nawawī in his commentary on Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.
