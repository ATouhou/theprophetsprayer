    [NB:]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"} These two aḥādīth show that the sunnah is to fix one's sight on the place of prostration on the ground, so the action of some worshippers of closing their eyes during Prayer is misdirected piety, for the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad \pbuh.

[^83]: Abū Dāwūd and Aḥmad with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād (_Irwāʾ_, #\ 1771); what is meant here by 'the House' is the Kaʿbah, as the context of this ḥadīth shows.

[^96]: al--Bukhārī, Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah. The Messenger \pbuh did not order the wiping out or tearing of the pictures but only removed them because -- and Allaah knows best -- they were not pictures of things having souls. The evidence for this is that he \pbuh tore other pictures as proved by many narrations in al--Bukhārī and Muslim, and whoever wishes to explore this further should consult _Fatḥ al--Bārī_ (10/321) and _Ghāyah al--Marām fī Takhrīj Aḥādīth al--Ḥalāl wa al--Ḥarām_ (nos. 131-145).
