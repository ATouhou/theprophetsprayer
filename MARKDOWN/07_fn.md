[^81]: Al-Bayhaqī and al-Ḥākim, who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and it is as he said. It also has a strengthening _ḥadīth_ reported by ten of his Companions: transmitted by Ibn ʿAsākir (17/202/2). See _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (#354).

    [NB:]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"} These two _aḥādīth_ show that the _sunnah_ is to fix one's sight on the place of prostration on the ground, so the action of some worshipers of closing their eyes during Prayer is misdirected piety, for the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad \pbuh.

[^82]: Ibid.

[^83]: Abū Dāwūd and Aḥmad with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_ (_Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_, #1771); what is meant here by ‘the House’ is the _Kaʿbah_, as the context of this _ḥadīth_ shows.

[^96]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and Abū ʿAwānah. The Messenger \pbuh did not order the wiping out or tearing of the pictures but only removed them because---and Allāh knows best---they were not pictures of things having souls. The evidence for this is that he \pbuh tore other pictures as proved by many narrations in al-Bukhārī and Muslim, and whoever wishes to explore this further should consult _Fatḥ al-Bārī_ (10/321) and _Ghāyah al-Marām fī Takhrīj Aḥādīth al-Ḥalāl wa al-Ḥarām_ (#131--145).
