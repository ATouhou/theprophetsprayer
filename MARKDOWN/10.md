# The Rukūʿ

After completing his recitation, he \pbuh would pause for a moment,[^d21] then raise his hands[^d22] in the way described earlier under the "Opening Takbīr," say takbīr,[^d23] and make rukūʿ.[^d24]

He also ordered "the one who prayed badly" likewise, saying to him, "Indeed, the prayer of one of you is not complete until he makes an excellent ablution as Allāh has commanded him to...then he celebrates Allāh's greatness, praises and glorifies Him, then recites the Qurʾān as much as is easy for him from what Allāh has taught him and allowed him, then says takbīr and makes rukūʿ [and places his hands on his knees] until his joints are at ease and relaxed."[^d25]

## The _rukūʿ_ described

"He \pbuh would place his palms on his knees,"[^d26] and "would order them to do likewise,"[^d27] as he ordered "the one who prayed badly" in the aforementioned ḥadīth.

"He would put his hands firmly on his knees [as though he were grasping them],"[^d28] and "would space his fingers out,"[^d29] ordering "the one who prayed badly" likewise, saying: "When you make rukūʿ, place your palms on your knees, then space your fingers out, then remain (like that) until every limb takes its (proper) place."[^d30]

"He used to spread himself (i.e. not be in a compact position), and keep his elbows away from his sides."[^d31]

"When he made rukūʿ, he would spread his back and make it level,"[^d32] "such that if water were poured on it, it (the water) would stay there (i.e. not run off)."[^d33] He also said to "the one who prayed badly," "When you make rukūʿ, put your palms on your knees, spread your back (flat) and hold firm in your rukūʿ."[^d34]

"He would neither let his head droop nor raise it (i.e. higher than his back),"[^d35] but it would be in between.[^d36]

## The obligation of being at ease in _rukūʿ_

He used to be at ease in his rukūʿ, and ordered "the one who prayed badly" to be so, as has been mentioned in the first section on rukūʿ.

He used to say, "Complete the rukūʿ and sujūd, for by Him in whose Hand is my soul, I surely see you behind my back[^d37] when you make rukūʿ and sujūd."[^d38]

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

"He saw a man praying not completing his rukūʿ properly, and pecking in his sujood, so he said, 'Were this man to die in this state, he would die on a faith other than that of Muḥammad, [pecking in his prayer as a crow pecks at blood; he who does not make rukūʿ completely and pecks in his sujūd is like the hungry person who eats one or two dates, which are of no use to him at all.]'[^d39]

Abū Hurayrah said, "My close friend \pbuh forbade me from pecking in my prayer like a cockerel, from looking around like a fox, and from squatting like a monkey."[^d40]

The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh also used to say, "The worst thief among men is the one who steals from his prayer." They said, "O Messenger of Allāh, how does he steal from his prayer?" He said, "He does not complete its rukūʿ and sujūd."[^d41]

Once, "he was praying, when he glanced out of the corner of his eye at a man not settling his backbone in rukūʿ and sujūd. When he finished, he said, 'O assembly of Muslims! Verily, the prayer is not valid of the one who does not settle his spine in rukūʿ and sujūd.'"[^d42]

He said in another ḥadīth, "The prayer of a man does not count unless he straightens his back in rukūʿ and sujūd."[^d43]

## The _adhkār_ in _rukūʿ_

He would say different types of remembrance of Allāh and supplication,
any one of the following at a time:

1.  <div lang="ar">سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ</div>

    "How Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme!," three times.[^d44] But sometimes, he would repeat it more than that.[^d45] Once, in night prayer, he repeated it so much that his rukūʿ became nearly as long as his standing before it, in which he had recited three of the Long Sūrahs: al-Baqarah, al-Nisāʾ and Āl ʿImrān. This prayer was full of supplication and seeking forgiveness, and the ḥadīth has already been mentioned under "Recitation in Night Prayer."

2.  <div lang="ar">سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ وبِحَمْدِهِ</div>

    "How Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme, and Praised be He," three times.[^d46]

3.  <div lang="ar">سُبُّوحٌ قُدُّوسٌ، رَبُّ الْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالرُّوحِ</div>

    "Perfect, Blessed,[^d47] Lord of the Angels and the Spirit."[^d48]

4.  <div lang="ar">سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي</div>

    "How Perfect You are O Allāh, and Praises are for You. O Allāh, forgive me." He would say it often in his rukūʿ and sujūd, implementing (the order of) the Qurʾān.[^d49]

5.  <div lang="ar">اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ رَكَعْتُ، وَبِكَ آمَنْتُ، وَلَكَ أَسْلَمْتُ، [أَنْتَ رَبِّي]، خَشَعَ لَكَ سَمْعِي وَبَصَرِي وَمُخِّي وَعَظْمِي (وفي رواية: وَعِظَامِي ) وَعَصَبِي، [وَمَا اسْتَقَلَّتْ بِهِ قَدَمَيَّ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ].</div>

    "O Allāh! To You I have bowed; in You I have believed; to You I have submitted; [You are my Lord]; humbled for You are my hearing, my seeing, my marrow, my bone (in one narration: my bones), my sinews, [and whatever my feet carry[^d50](are humbled) for Allāh, Lord of the Worlds]."[^d51]

6.  <div lang="ar">اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ رَكَعْتُ، وَبِكَ آمَنْتُ، وَلَكَ أَسْلَمْتُ، وَعَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْتُ، أَنْتَ رَبِّي، خَشَعَ سَمْعِي وَبَصَرِي وَدَمِي وَلَحْمِي وَعَظْمِي وَعَصَبِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ.</div>

    "O Allāh! to You I have bowed; in You I have believed; to You I have submitted; in You I have placed my trust; You are my Lord; my hearing, my seeing, my blood, my flesh, my bones, and my sinews are humbled for Allāh, Lord of the Worlds."[^d52]

7.  <div lang="ar">سُبْحَانَ ذِي الْجَبَرُوتِ وَالْمَلَكُوتِ وَالْكِبْرِيَاءِ وَالْعَظَمَةِ</div>

    "How Perfect is He Who has all Power, Kingdom, Magnificence and Supremity," which he used to say in night prayer.

## Lengthening the _rukūʿ_

"He \pbuh used to make his rukūʿ, his standing after rukūʿ, his sujūd, and his sitting in between the two sajdahs, nearly equal in length."[^d53]

## Forbiddance of reciting the Qurʾān in _rukūʿ_

"He used to forbid recitation of the Qurʾān in rukūʿ and sujūd."[^d54] Further, he used to say, "Verily, I have indeed been forbidden from reciting the Qurʾān in rukūʿ or sujūd. In the rukūʿ, therefore, glorify the Supremity of the Lord, Mighty and Sublime, in it; as for the sujūd, exert yourselves in supplication in it, for it is most likely that you will be answered.[^d55]

## Straightening up from _rukūʿ_, and what is to be said then

Next, "he \pbuh would straighten up his back out of rukūʿ, saying,

<div lang="ar">سَمِعَ اللَّهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَهُ</div>  
'Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.'[^d56]

He also ordered 'the one who prayed badly' to do that, when he said to him: No person's prayer is complete until...he has said takbīr...then made rukūʿ...then has said 'Allāh listens to the one who praises Him' until he is standing straight."[^d57] When he raised his head, he would stand straight until every vertebra returned to its place.[^d58]

Next, "he would say while standing:

<div lang="ar">رَبَّنَا وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ</div>  
'Our Lord, [and] to You be all Praise.'"[^d59]

He has commanded all worshippers, whether behind an imām or not, to do the above on rising from rukūʿ, by saying "Pray as you have seen me praying."[^d60]

He also used to say, "The imām is there to be followed...when he has said 'Allāh listens to the one who praises Him' then say, '[O Allāh!] Our Lord, and to You be all Praise;' Allāh will listen to you, for indeed, Allāh, Blessed and Exalted, has said via the tongue of His Prophet \pbuh: Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.'"[^d61]

He also gave a reason for this command in another ḥadīth, saying: "for he whose saying coincides with that of the angels will have his past sins forgiven."[^d62]

He used to raise his hands when straightening up,[^d63] in the ways described under the "Opening Takbīr."

While standing, he would say, as previously-mentioned,

1.  <div lang="ar">رَبَّنَا وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ</div>  
    "Our Lord, and to You be all Praise;"[^d64] or

2.  <div lang="ar">رَبَّنَا َلَكَ الْحَمْدُ</div>  
    "Our Lord, to You be all Praise."[^d65]

Sometimes, he would add at the beginning of either of these:

3.  <div lang="ar">اللَّهُمَّ</div>

    "O Allāh!..."[^d66]

    He used to order others to do this, saying, "When the imām says: 'Allāh listens to the one who praises Him,' then say: 'O Allāh! Our Lord, to You be all Praise,' for he whose saying coincides with that of the angels will have his past sins forgiven."[^d67]

Sometimes, he would add either:

4.  <div lang="ar">مِلْءَ السَّمَاوَاتِ، وَمِلْءَ الأَرْضِ، وَمِلْءَ مَا شِئْتَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ بَعْدُ</div>  
    "...Filling the heavens, filling the earth, and filling whatever else You wish,"[^d68]

or

5.  <div lang="ar">مِلْءَ السَّمَاوَاتِ، [وَمِلْءَ] الأَرْضِ، وما بَيْنَهُمَا وَمِلْءَ مَا شِئْتَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ بَعْدُ</div>  
    "...Filling the heavens, [filling] the earth, whatever is between them, and filling whatever else You wish."[^d69]

Sometimes, he would add even further:

6.  <div lang="ar">أَهْلَ الثَّنَاءِ وَالْمَجْدِ، لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَدُّ</div>  
    "Lord of Glory and Majesty! None can withhold what You grant, and none can grant what You withhold; nor can the possessions of an owner benefit him in front of You."[^d70]

Or, sometimes, the addition would be:

7.  <div lang="ar">مِلْءَ السَّمَاوَاتِ، وَمِلْءَ الأَرْضِ، وما بَيْنَهُمَا وَمِلْءَ مَا شِئْتَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ بَعْدُ، أَهْلَ الثَّنَاءِ وَالْمَجْدِ، أَحَقُّ مَا قَالَ العَبْدُ، وَكُلُّنَا لَكَ عَبْدٌ، [اللَّهُمَّ]  لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، [وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ،] وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَدُّ</div>  
    "Filling the heavens, filling the earth, and filling whatever else You wish. Lord of Glory and Majesty!---The truest thing a slave has said, and we are all slaves to You. [O Allāh!] None can withhold what You grant, [and none can grant what You withhold,] nor can the possessions of an owner benefit him in front of You."[^d71]

Sometimes, he would say the following during night prayer:

8.  <div lang="ar">لِرَبِّيَ الْحَمْدُ، لِرَبِّيَ الْحَمْدُ</div>
    "To my Lord be all Praise, to my Lord be all Praise," repeating it until his standing was about as long as his rukūʿ, which had been nearly as long as his first standing, in which he had recited Sūrah al-Baqarah.[^d72]

9.  <div lang="ar">رَبَّنَا وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ حَمْدًا كَثِيرًا طَيِّبًا مُبَارَكًا فِيهِ، [مُبَارَكًا عَلَيْهِ كَمَا يُحِبُّ رَبُّنَا وَيَرْضَى]</div>  
    "Our Lord, and to You be all Praise, so much pure praise, inherently blessed, [externally blessed, as our Lord loves and is pleased with]."[^d73]

    A man praying behind him \pbuh said this after he \pbuh had raised his head from rukūʿ and said: "Allāh listens to the one who praises Him." When the Messenger of Allāh had finished his prayer, he said, "Who was the one speaking just now?" The man said, "It was I, O Messenger of Allāh." So the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said, "I saw over thirty angels hurrying to be the first one to write it down."[^d74]

## Lengthening this standing, and the obligation to be at ease in it

He \pbuh used to make this standing about as long as his rukūʿ, as has been mentioned; in fact, "he would stand (for so long) sometimes that one would say, 'He has forgotten', [because of his standing for so long.]"[^d75]

He used to instruct them to be at ease in it; hence, he said to "the one who prayed badly,"..."next, raise your head until you are standing straight [and every bone has taken its proper place]"---in another narration, "When you rise, make your spine upright and raise your head, until the bones return to their joints."[^d76]

<!-- TODO check no-one's spelling -->

He also reminded him: that no one's prayer is complete unless he does that, and used to say: "Allāh, Mighty and Sublime, does not look at the prayer of the slave who does not make his backbone upright in between his bowings and prostrations."[^d77]
