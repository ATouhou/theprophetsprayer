[\"The one who prayed badly\" (radi Allaahu \`anhu)]{#RTFToC2}
--------------------------------------------------------------

In Hadeeth and Fiqh literature, this term refers to the Companion
mentioned in the following hadeeth of Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Book of
Prayer, English translation by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan); many other
narrations of this incident are found in the various collections of
hadeeth, and provide an important source of instructions from the
Prophet (sallallaahu \`alaihi wa sallam) regarding the correct way to
pray:

Narrated Abu Hurairah (radi Allaahu \`anhu):

> The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu \`alaihi wa sallam) entered the
> mosque and a person followed him. The man prayed and then went to the
> Prophet (sallallaahu \`alaihi wa sallam) and greeted him; he returned
> the greeting and said (to him), **Go back and pray, for you have not
> prayed.** The man went back and prayed in the same way as before, and
> then returned and greeted the Prophet (sallallaahu \`alaihi wa
> sallam), who said, **Go back and pray, for you have not prayed,**
> three times. The man said, \"By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I
> cannot do so any better than this, so please teach me.\" He said,
> **When you stand for the Prayer, say takbeer and then recite what is
> easy for you from the Qur\'aan (from what you know by heart); then bow
> until you feel at ease in rukoo\`; then raise your head and stand up
> straight, then prostrate until you feel at ease in sajdah; then sit
> with calmness until you feel at ease, and do likewise in all your
> prayers.**

\[further narrations of this hadeeth found in the other works of Hadeeth
such as Sunan Abi Daawood, etc. contain further details.\]
