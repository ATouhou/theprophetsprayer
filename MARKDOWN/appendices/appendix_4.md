# The weakness of the narration about placing the hands below the navel

From _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (#353) and _Aḥkām al-Janāʾiz_ (p.\ 118), by Shaykh al-Albānī.

Abū Dāwūd (756), al-Dāraquṭnī (107), a-Bayhaqi (2/310), Aḥmad in his son ʿAbd Allāh's _Masāʾil_ (62/2) and also in _Zawāʾid al-Musnad_ (1/110), and Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/156/1) transmitted:

ʿAn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq ʿan Ziyād ibn Zayd al-Siwaa'i ʿan Abū Juhayfah ʿan ʿAli (May Allāh be pleased with him), who said, “It is from the Sunnah during the prayer to place one palm on the other, below the navel.”

This is a _ḍaʿīf_ (weak) _sanad_ due to ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq (al-Wasiti al-Kūfī), who is weak (see below). On top of that, it has _idtirāb_ (shakiness) in it, for he has narrated it:

1. Once ʿan Ziyād ʿan Abū Juhayfa ʿan ʿAlī (as above);
2. Once ʿan Nuʿmān ibn Saʿd ʿan ʿAlī (transmitted by al-Dāraquṭnī and al-Bayhaqī); and
3. once ʿan Siyās Abū al-Ḥakam ʿan Abū Wā'il, who said, “Abū Hurayrah said: It is from the Sunnah...” (transmitted by Abū Dāwūd (758) and al-Dāraquṭnī).

## The Weakness of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq al-Kūfī in the eyes of the Imāms of Ḥadīth {.unnumbered}

1. Abū Dāwūd said, “I heard Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal declaring ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq al-Kūfī _daʿīf_ (weak).” This is why Imām Aḥmad did not accept this _ḥadīth_ of his, for his son ʿAbd Allāh said, “I saw that when praying, my father placed his hands, one on the other, above the navel.”
2. al-Nawawī said in _al-Majmūʿ_ (3/313), and also in _Sharḥ Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim_ and elsewhere, “They (i.e. the scholars of _ḥadīth_) agree in declaring this _ḥadīth_ weak, because it is a narration of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq al-Wāsitī, who is a _daʿīf_ (weak) narrator, as agreed upon by the Imāms of Jarḥ and Taʿdīl (Authentication and Disparagement of reporters).”
3. Al-Zaylaʿī said in _Naṣb al-Rāyah_ (1/314), “Al-Bayhaqī said in _al-Maʿrifah_: ‘Its _isnād_ is not firm, for it is a unique narration of ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq al-Wāsitī, who is _matrūk_ (abandoned).’”
4. Ibn Ḥajar said in _Fatḥ al-Bārī_ (2/186), “It is a weak _ḥadīth_.”

What further points to its weakness is that contrary to it has been narrated on the authority of ʿAli with a better _isnād_: the _ḥadīth_ of Ibn Jarīr al-Dabbī _ʿan_ his father, who said, “I saw ʿAli (May Allāh be pleased with him) holding his left arm with his right on the wrist, _above the navel_” -- this _isnād_ is a candidate for the rank of _ḥasan_; Al-Bayhaqī (1/301) firmly designated it to be _ḥasan_, and al-Bukhārī (1/301) designated it with certainty while giving it in an abridged, _taʿlīq_ form.

What is authentic from the Prophet \pbuh with respect to the position of the hands is that they should be on the chest; there are many _aḥādīth_ about this, among them is one on the authority of Ṭāwūs, who said, “The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh used to place his right arm on his left arm, and clasp them firmly on his chest during prayer” -- transmitted by Abū Dāwūd (759) with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_. Although this is _mursal_, it is enough as proof for all scholars, with all their various opinions regarding the _mursal ḥadīth_, since it is _ṣaḥīḥ_ as a _mursal isnād_ and has also been related as _mawsūl_ in many narrations; hence, it is valid as proof for all. Some of the supporting narrations are as follows:

1. from Wāʾil ibn Ḥujr: “That he saw the Prophet \pbuh put his right hand upon his left and place them upon his chest.” Reported by Ibn Khuzaymah in his _Ṣaḥīḥ_ (_Naṣb al-Rāyah_, 1/314) and reported by al-Bayhaqī in his _Sunan_ (2/30) with two chains of narration which support each other.
2. from Qabīsah ibn Ḥulb, from his father who said: “I saw the Prophet \pbuh, leave after completing the prayer from his right and his left, and I saw him place this upon his chest -- Yaḥyā (Ibn Saʿīd) described the right (hand) upon the left above the joint.” Reported by Aḥmad (5/226) with a chain of narrators who are of the standard set by Muslim except for Qabīsah, but he is declared reliable by al-ʿIjlī and Ibn Ḥibbān; however, no one narrates from him except Simāk ibn Ḥarb about whom Ibn al-Madīnī and al-Nasāʾī say: “Unknown” and Ibn Ḥajar says in _al-Taqrīb_: “He is _Maqbūl_, i.e. acceptable only if supported.” The _ḥadīth_ of one such as him are _ḥasan_ as supporting narrations, and therefore al-Tirmidhī said after quoting the part of this _ḥadīth_ concerning taking the left hand with the right, “"It is a _ḥasan ḥadīth_.”

So these are three _aḥādīth_ which show that the Sunnah is to place the hands on the chest, and one who comes across them will not doubt that together they are sufficient to prove this.
