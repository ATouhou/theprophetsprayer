[The weakness of the hadeeth about placing the hands below the navel.]{#RTFToC2} {#the-weakness-of-the-hadeeth-about-placing-the-hands-below-the-navel. align="left"}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from Irwaa\' al-Ghaleel (353) & Ahkaam al-Janaa\'iz ( p. 118), by Shaykh
al-Albaani

Abu Daawood (756), Daaraqutni (107), Baihaqi (2/310), Ahmad in his son
\`Abdullaah\'s Masaa\'il (62/2) and also in Zawaa\'id al-Musnad (1/110),
and Ibn Abi Shaiba (1/156/1) transmitted:

\`an \`Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Ishaaq \`an Ziyaad ibn Zaid as-Siwaa\'i \`an
Abu Juhaifah \`an \`Ali (radi Allaahu \`anhu), who said, \"It is from
the Sunnah during the prayer to place one palm on the other, below the
navel.\"

This is a da\`eef (weak) sanad due to \`Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Ishaaq
(al-Waasiti al-Koofi), who is weak (see below). On top of that, it has
idtiraab (shakiness) in it, for he has narrated it:

1.  once \`an Ziyad \`an Abu Juhaifa \`an \`Ali (as above);
2.  once \`an Nu\`man ibn Sa\`d\`an \`Ali (transmitted by Daaraqutni and
    Baihaqi); and
3.  once \`an Siyaas Abul Hakam \`an Abu Waa\'il, who said, \"Abu
    Hurairah said: It is from the Sunnah ...\" (transmitted by Abu
    Dawood \[758\] and Daaraqutni).

[The Weakness of \`Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Ishaaq al-Koofi in the eyes of the Imaams of Hadeeth]{#RTFToC3}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Abu Daawood** said, \"I heard **Ahmad ibn Hanbal** declaring \`Abd
    ar-Rahmaan ibn Ishaaq al-Koofi da\`eef (weak).\" \[This is why Imaam
    Ahmad did not accept this hadeeth of his, for his son \`Abdullaah
    said, \"I saw that when praying, my father placed his hands, one on
    the other, above the navel.\"\]
2.  **Nawawi** said in Majmoo\` (3/313), and also in Sharh Saheeh Muslim
    and elsewhere, \"They (the scholars of hadeeth) agree in declaring
    this hadeeth weak, because it is a narration of \`Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn
    Ishaaq al-Waasiti, who is a da\`eef (weak) narrator, as agreed upon
    by the Imaams of Jarh and Ta\`deel (Authentication and Disparagement
    of reporters).\"
3.  **Zayla\`i** said in Nasb ar-Raayah (1/314), **\"Baihaqi** said in
    al-Ma\`rifah: \`Its isnaad is not firm, for it is a unique narration
    of \`Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Ishaaq al-Waasiti, who is matrook
    (abandoned)\'.\"
4.  **Ibn Hajar** said in Fath al-Baari (2/186), \"It is a weak
    hadeeth.\"

What further points to its weakness is that contrary to it has been
narrated on the authority of \`Ali with a better isnaad: the hadeeth of
Ibn Jareer al-Dabbi `` `an `` his father, who said, \"I saw \`Ali (radi
Allaahu \`anhu) holding his left arm with his right on the wrist,
**above the navel\"** - this isnaad is a candidate for the rank of
`hasan`; Baihaqi (1/301) firmly designated it to be hasan, and Bukhaari
(1/301) designated it with certainty while giving it in an abridged,
ta\`leeq form.

What is authentic from the Prophet (sallallaahu \`alaihi wa sallam) with
respect to the position of the hands is that they should be on the
chest; there are many ahaadeeth about this, among them is one on the
authority of Taawoos, who said, \"The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu
\`alaihi wa sallam) used to place his right arm on his left arm, and
clasp them firmly on his chest during prayer\" - transmitted by Abu
Daawood (759) with a saheeh isnaad. Although this is mursal, it is
enough as proof for all scholars, with all their various opinions
regarding the Mursal Hadeeth, since it is saheeh as a mursal isnaad and
has also been related as mawsool in many narrations; hence, it is valid
as proof for all. Some of the supporting narrations are as follows:

1.  from Waa\'il ibn Hujr: \"That he saw the Prophet - sallallaahu
    \`alaihi wa sallam - put his right hand upon his left and place them
    upon his chest.\" Reported by Ibn Khuzaimah in his Saheeh (Nasb
    ar-Raayah, 1/314) and reported by Baihaqi in his Sunan (2/30) with
    two chains of narration which support each other.
2.  from Qabeesah ibn Hulb, from his father who said:\
    \"I saw the Prophet (sallallaahu \`alaihi wa sallam), leave \[after
    completing the Prayer\] from his right and his left, and I saw him
    place this upon his chest - Yahyaa (Ibn Sa\'eed) described the right
    (hand) upon the left above the joint.\"\
    Reported by Ahmad (5/226) with a chain of narrators who are of the
    standard set by Muslim except for Qabeesah, but he is declared
    reliable by \'Ijli & Ibn Hibbaan; however, no one narrates from him
    except Simaak ibn Harb about whom Ibn al-Madeeni and Nasaa\'i say:
    \"Unknown\" and Ibn Hajar says in Taqreeb: \"He is \`Maqbool\'
    \[i.e. acceptable only if supported\].\" The hadeeth of one such as
    him are hasan as supporting narrations, and therefore Tirmidhi said
    after quoting the part of this hadeeth concerning taking the left
    hand with the right, \"It is a hasan hadeeth.\"

So these are three ahaadeeth which show that the Sunnah is to place the
hands on the chest, and one who comes across them will not doubt that
together they are sufficient to prove this.
