meanings by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan

Narrated Ibn \`Abbaas (Allaah be pleased with him):

> A man came to Allaah\'s Messenger (sallallaahu \`alaihi wa sallam) and
> said, \"I saw in a dream, a cloud having shade. Butter and honey were
> dropping from it and I saw the people gathering it in their hands,
> some gathering much and some little. And behold, there was a rope
> extending from the earth to the sky, and I saw that you held it and
> went up; then, another man held it and went up and (after that)
> another (third) man held it and went up, and then another (fourth) man
> held it, but it broke and then got connected again.\" Abu Bakr said,
> \"O Allaah\'s Messenger! Let my father be sacrificed for you! By
> Allaah, allow me to interpret this dream.\" The Prophet (sallallaahu
> \`alaihi wa sallam) said to him, **Interpret it.** Abu Bakr said,
> \"The cloud with shade symbolises Islaam, and the butter and the honey
> dropping from it symbolises the Qur\'aan, it\'s sweetness and some
> people learning much of the Qur\'aan while some a little. The rope
> which is extended from the sky to the earth is the Truth which you
> (the Prophet (sallallaahu \`alaihi wa sallam) are following. You
> follow it and Allaah will raise you high with it, and then another
> person will follow it and will rise up with it and then another man
> will follow it but it will break and then it will be connected for him
> and he will rise up with it. O Allaah\'s Messenger! Let my father be
> sacrificed for you! Am I right or wrong?\" The Prophet (sallallaahu
> \`alaihi wa sallam) replied, **You are right in some of it and wrong
> in some of it.** Abu Bakr said, \"O Allaah\'s Prophet! By Allaah, you
> must tell me in what I was wrong.\" The Prophet (sallallaahu \`alaihi
> wa sallam) said, **Do not swear.**
