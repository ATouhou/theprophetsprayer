# Recitation

Next, he \pbuh would seek refuge with Allāh the Exalted, saying:

<div lang="ar">أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ مِنْ هَمْزِهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِهِ</div>  
"I seek refuge with Allāh from the Evil One, the Rejected, from his madness,[^123] his arrogance, and his poetry."[^124] Sometimes he would add to this, saying:

<div lang="ar">أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ...</div>  
"I seek refuge with Allāh, the all-Hearing, the all-Knowing, from the Evil One..."[^125]

Then he would recite,

<div lang="ar">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ</div>  
"In the Name of Allāh, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy," but not loudly[^126]

## Recitation of one Verse at a Time

Next, he would recite Sūrah al-Fātiḥah and divide his recitation, reciting one verse at a time. He would say:

<div lang="ar">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ</div>

[Here he would pause, and then say:]

<div lang="ar">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</div>

[Then he would pause, and then say:]

<div lang="ar">الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ</div>

[Then he would pause, and then say:]

<div lang="ar">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</div>

...and so on, until the end of the sūrah. The rest of his recitation was also like this: stopping at the end of the verse and not joining it with the one after.[^127]

Sometimes, he would recite,

<div lang="ar">مَلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</div>  
"King of the Day of Judgment," instead of

<div lang="ar">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</div>  
"Master of the Day of Judgment."[^128]

## The Necessity of al-Fātiḥah, and its Excellence

He would vehemently emphasise the importance of this sūrah, saying: "There is no prayer for the one who did not recite [in it] the opening chapter [at least],"[^129] and in another saying: "That prayer is not sufficient in which a man does not recite the Opening of the Book."[^130]" He also said: "He who performs a prayer in which he does not recite the Opening of the Book, then it (i.e. the prayer) is deficient, it is deficient, it is deficient, incomplete.[^131] He also said:

> Allāh the Blessed and Exalted has said:
> "I have divided the prayer[^132] between Myself and My servant, into two halves: half of it is for Me and half is for My servant, and My servant shall have what he has asked for."

Then the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said:

> Recite! The servant says "Praise be to Allāh, the Lord of the Worlds;" Allāh the Exalted says, "My servant has praised Me." The servant says, "The Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy;" Allāh says, "My servant has extolled Me." The servant says "Master of the Day of Judgment;" Allāh the Exalted says, "My servant has glorified Me." The servant says, "It is You (alone) we worship and it is You (alone) we ask for help;" [He says:] "This is between Me and My servant, and My servant shall have what he has asked for." The servant says, "Guide us to the Straight Path, the Path of those whom You have favoured, not of those who receive Your anger, nor of those who go astray." [He says:] "All these are for My servant, and My servant shall have what he has asked for."[^133]

He also used to say: "Allāh did not reveal in the Torah or the Gospel anything like the Mother of the Qurʾān. It is the Seven Oft-Repeated[^134][and the Grand Recitation which have been bestowed upon me].[^135]

He \pbuh commanded "the one who prayed badly" to recite it in his prayer,[^136] but said to one who could not remember it, "Say:

<div lang="ar">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ، وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ، وَلا إِلَهَ إِلا اللَّهُ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ،  وَلا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إِلا بِاللَّه</div>  
'I declare Allāh free from all defects; all Praise be to Allāh; none has the right to be worshipped but Allāh; Allāh is the Greatest; there is no might or power except by Allāh.'"[^137]

He also said to 'the one who prayed badly': "If you know some of the Qurʾān, then recite it, otherwise praise Allāh, declare His Greatness and declare that none has the right to be worshipped but Allāh;"[^138]

## The Abrogation of Recitation behind the Imām in the Loud Prayers

He had given permission for those being led by the Imām to recite Sūrah al-Fātiḥah in the loud prayers, when once:

> he was praying Fajr and the recitation became difficult for him. When he finished, he said: "Perhaps you recite behind your Imām." We said: "Yes, quickly,[^139] O Messenger of Allāh." He said: "Do not do so, except for [each of you reciting] the opening chapter of the Book, for the prayer is not valid of the one who does not recite it."[^140]

Later, he forbade them from reciting in the loud prayers at all, when:

> He finished a prayer in which he was reciting loudly (in one narration: it was the dawn prayer) and said: "Were any of you reciting with me just now?!" A man said: "Yes, I was, O Messenger of Allāh." He said: "I say, why am I contended with?" [Abū Hurayrah said:] So the people stopped reciting with the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh when he was reciting loudly after hearing that from him [but they recited to themselves quietly when the imaam was not reciting loudly]."[^141]

He also made silence during the Imām's recitation part of the completeness of following the Imām, saying: "The Imām is there to be followed, so when he says takbīr, say takbīr, and when he recites, be silent,[^142] just as he made listening to the Imām's recitation enough to not have to recite behind him, saying: "He who has an Imām, then the recitation of the Imām is recitation for him[^143]---this applying in the loud prayers.

## The Obligation to Recite in the Quiet Prayers

As for the quiet prayers, he urged them to recite during them; Jābir said, "We used to recite behind the Imām in Ẓuhr and ʿAṣr: Sūrah al-Fātiḥah and another sūrah in the first two rakʿahs, and sūrah al-Fātiḥah in the last two."[^144]

However, he dissuaded them from confusing him with their recitation, when:

> he prayed Ẓuhr with his Companions and said (afterwards): "Which of you recited 'Glorify the name of your Lord the Most High (Sūrah al-Aʿlā, 87)?'" Someone said: It was I [but I was only intending nothing but good by doing so]. So he said: "I knew that someone was contending with me by it."[^145] In another ḥadīth: "They used to recite behind the Prophet \pbuh [loudly], so he said: 'You have mixed up my (recitation of the) Qurʾān.'"[^146]

He also said: "Truly, the person praying is privately consulting his Lord, so he should be careful about what he consults him with, and you should not recite the Qurʾān loudly over each other."[^147]

He also used to say: "Whoever recited a ḥarf (letter) from the Book of Allāh, it will count for him as one good deed, and a good deed is worth ten times over. I do not mean that "alif lām mīm" is a ḥarf, but "alif" is a ḥarf, "lām" is a ḥarf, and "mīm" is a ḥarf."[^148]

## The āmīn, and the Imām's saying it Loudly

When he \pbuh finished reciting Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, he would say:

<div lang="ar">آمِين</div>

("āmīn") loudly, prolonging his voice.[^149]

He also used to order the congregation to say āmīn: "When the Imām says,

<div lang="ar">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</div>

'Not of those who receive (Your) anger, nor of those who go astray,' then say 'āmīn' [for the angels say 'āmīn' and the Imām says 'āmīn'](in another narration: when the Imām says 'āmīn' say 'āmīn'), so he whose āmīn coincides with the āmīn of the angels (in another narration: when one of you says 'āmīn' in prayer and the angels in the sky say 'āmīn,' and they coincide), his past sins are forgiven."[^150] In another ḥadīth: "...then say āmīn; Allāh will answer you."[^151]

He also used to say: "The Jews do not envy you over anything as much as they envy you over the salutation and āmīn [behind the Imām]."[^152]

## The Recitation after Sūrah al-Fātiḥah

Next, he \pbuh would recite another sūrah after Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, making it long sometimes, and on other occasions making it short because of travel, cough, illness or the crying of infants.

Anas ibn Mālik said: "He \pbuh made it [i.e. the recitation] short one day in the dawn prayer." (In another ḥadīth: he prayed the morning prayer and recited the two shortest sūrahs in the Qurʾān.) So it was said: "O Messenger of Allāh, why did you make it short?" He said: "I heard the crying of a child, and I supposed that his mother was praying with us, so I wanted to free his mother for him."[^153]

He also used to say: "I enter into prayer intending to lengthen it, but I hear the crying of a child so I shorten my prayer because I know how deeply his mother feels about his crying."[^154]

He used to start from the beginnning of a sūrah, completing it most of the time.[^155]

He used to say: "Give every sūrah its share of rukūʿ and sujūd."[^156] In another narration: "Every sūrah should have a rakʿah."[^157]

Sometimes he would divide the sūrah into two rakʿahs[^158] and sometimes he would repeat the whole sūrah in the second rakʿah.[^159]

Sometimes he would combine two or more sūrahs in one rakʿah.[^160]

One of the Anṣār used to lead them in the mosque of Qubāʾ, and every time he recited a sūrah[^161] for them, he would begin with "Say: He is Allāh, the One and Only" (Sūrah al-Ikhlāṣ, 112) until its end, and then recite another sūrah with it, and he would do this in every rakʿah. Because of this, his people spoke to him, saying: "You begin with this sūrah, and then you do not regard it as enough until you recite another one: you should either recite it (only) or leave it and recite another one. He said: "I will not leave it: if you do not mind me leading you with it, I shall carry on, but if you do not like it, I shall leave you." They knew that he was one of their best, and they did not like to be led by anyone else, so when the Prophet \pbuh came to them, they told him the story. He \pbuh said: "O so-and-so, what stops you from doing what your people ask you to? What makes you recite this sūrah in every rakʿah?" He said: "I love this sūrah." He said: "Your love for it will enter you into the Garden."[^162]

## Combining Similar Soorahs and others in One Rak'ah

He used to combine the pairs[^163] of the mufaṣṣal[^164] sūrahs, so he used to recite one of the following pairs of sūrahs in one rakʿah[^165]:

<!-- TODO double check number of ayahs -->

- al-Raḥmān (55:{78})[^166] and al-Najm (53:{62});
- al-Qamar (54:{55}) and al-Ḥāqqah (69:{52});
- al-Ṭūr (52:{49}) and al-Dhāriyāt (51:{60});
- al-Wāqiʿah (56:{96}) and al-Qalam (68:{52});
- al-Maʿārij (70:{44}) and al-Nāziʿāt (79:{46});
- al-Muṭaffifīn (83:{36}) and ʿAbasa (80:{42});
- al-Muddaththir (74:{56}) and al-Muzzammil (73:{20});
- al-Dahr (al-Insān) (76:{31}) and al-Qiyāmah (75:{40});
- al-Nabāʾ (78:{40}) and al-Mursalāt (77:{50});
- al-Dukhān (44:{59}) and al-Takwīr (81:{29}).

Sometimes he would combine sūrahs from the seven ṭiwāl (long sūrahs), such as al-Baqarah, al-Nisāʾ and āl ʿImrān in one rakʿah during night prayer (below). He used to say: "The most excellent prayer is one with long standing."[^167]

When he recited, "Does He not have the power to give life to the dead? (Sūrah al-Qiyāmah 75:40)," he would say,

<div lang="ar">سُبْحَانَكَ فَبَلَى</div>  
"Glory be to You, of course!"

and when he recited, "Glorify the name of your Lord Most High (Sūrah al-Aʿlā, 87:1)," he would say,

سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْأَعْلَى  
"Glorified be my Lord Most High."[^168]

## The Permissibility of Reciting Sūrah al-Fātiḥah only

Muʿādh ibn Jabal used to pray ʿIshāʾ [the last] with the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh, and then return and lead his people in prayer. One night when he returned and prayed with them, a young man [called Sulaym, of the Banū Salamah] from his people prayed, but when it became too long for him, he [went away and] prayed [in the corner of the mosque,] then came out, took the reins of his camel and departed. When Muʿādh had prayed, this was mentioned to him, so he said: "He surely has some hypocrisy in him! I will surely tell the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh what he has done." The young man said: "And I will tell the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh what he has done." So in the morning they came to the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh, and Muʿādh informed him of what the young man had done. The young man said: "O Messenger of Allāh! He stays a long time with you, and then he returns and lengthens it for us." So the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said: "Are you one who causes great trouble, Muʿādh?!" and he said to the young man:[^169] "What do you do when you pray, son of my brother?" He said: "I recite the opening chapter of the Book, then I ask Allāh for the Garden, and seek refuge with Him from the Fire. I know neither your dandanah[^170] nor the dandanah of Muʿādh!" So the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said: "I and Muʿādh are similar in this."

The narrator said: The young man said, "But Muʿādh will know (about me) on going to the people when they will have been informed that the enemy has arrived." The narrator said: So the enemy came, and the young man attained shahādah (martyrdom). So after that the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said to Muʿādh, "What did the one disputing with me and you do?" He said, "O Messenger of Allāh, he was true to Allāh, and I spoke falsely---he was martyred."[^171]

## Quiet and Loud Recitation in the Five Prayers and others

He \pbuh used to recite loudly in the morning prayer and in the first two rakʿahs of Maghrib and ʿIshāʾ, and quietly in Ẓuhr, ʿAṣr, the third rakʿah of Maghrib and the last two rakʿahs of ʿIshāʾ.[^172]

They could tell when he was reciting quietly from the movement of his beard,[^173] and because he would let them hear an āyah or so sometimes.[^174]

He also recited loudly in Friday prayer and the two ʿEid prayers,[^175] in the prayer for rain,[^176] and in the eclipse prayer.[^177]

## Quiet and Loud Recitation in the Night Prayer (Tahajjud)

As for night prayer,[^178] he would sometimes recite quietly and sometimes loudly,[^179] and "he used to recite in his house such that he could be heard in the courtyard."[^180] "Occasionally he would raise his voice more than that until someone lying in bed could hear him (i.e. from outside the courtyard)."[^181]

He ordered Abū Bakr and ʿUmar likewise, when:

> he came out at night to find Abū Bakr praying in a low voice, and he passed by ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb who was praying in a loud voice. Later, when they gathered around the Prophet \pbuh said: "O Abū Bakr, I passed by you and you were praying in a low voice?" He said: "I let Him whom I was consulting hear, O Messenger of Allāh." He said to ʿUmar: "I passed by you and you were praying raising your voice?" So he said: "O Messenger of Allāh, I repel drowsiness and keep the devil away." The Prophet \pbuh said: "O Abū Bakr, raise your voice a little bit and to ʿUmar: lower your voice a little bit."[^182]

He used to say: "The one who recites the Qurʾān loudly is like the one who gives charity loudly, and the one who recites the Qurʾān quietly is like the one who gives charity quietly."[^183]

## What he \pbuh used to Recite in the Different Prayers

As for which sūrahs and āyāt he \pbuh used to recite in prayer, this varied according to the different prayers. The details now follow, beginning with the first of the five prayers:

### Fajr Prayer

<!-- TODO check number of ayahs -->

He \pbuh used to recite the longer mufaṣṣal[^184] sūrahs,[^185] hence "he (sometimes) recited al-Wāqiʿah (56:{96}) and similar sūrah in two rakʿahs."[^186]

He recited from sūrah al-Tūr (52:{49}) during the Farewell Pilgrimage.[^187]

Sometimes "he would recite Sūrah Qāf (50:{45}) or similar [in the first rakʿah]."[^188]

Sometimes "he would recite the shorter mufaṣṣal sūrahs, such as 'When the sun is folded up (Sūrah al-Takwīr, 81:{29}).'"[^189]

Once, he recited "When the Earth is shaken (Sūrah al-Zalzalah, 99:{8})" in both rak'ahs, so that the narrator said, "I do not know whether the Messenger of Allāh forgot or recited it on purpose."[^190]

Once, on a journey, he recited "Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak" (Sūrah al-Falaq, 113:{5}) and "Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Mankind (Sūrah al-Nās, 114:{6})."[^191] He also said to ʿUqbah ibn ʿĀamir: "Recite the muʿawwadhatayn[^192] in your prayer, for no seeker of refuge has sought refuge by means of anything like them."[^193]

Sometimes he used to recite more than that: "he would recite sixty āyāt or more"[^194]---one of the narrators said, "I do not know whether this was in each rakʿah or in total."

He used to recite Sūrah al-Rūm (30:{60})[^195] and sometimes Sūrah Yā Sīn (36:{83}).[^196]

Once, "he prayed the Subh [i.e. Fajr Prayer] in Makkah and started reciting Sūrah al-Muʾminūn (23:{118}) until, when he got to the mention of Mūsā and Hārūn or the mention of ʿIsā[^197]---one of the narrators was not sure---he started coughing and so made rukūʿ."[^198]

Sometimes, "he would lead them in Fajr with al-Sāffāt (77:{182})."[^199]

"In Fajr on Friday, he would recite al-Sajdah (32:{30}) [in the first rakʿah, and, in the second,] al-Dahr (76:{31})."[^200]

He used to make the first rakʿah longer than the second.[^201]

### Recitation in the Sunnah prayer before Fajr

His recitation in the two rakʿahs of sunnah in Fajr used to be extremely short,[^202] so much so that ʿĀʾishah used to say: "Has he recited Sūrah al-Fātiḥah or not?"[^203]

Sometimes, after al-Fātiḥah, he would recite the āyah "Say: We believe in Allāh and the revelation given to us... (Sūrah al-Baqarah 2:136)" in the first rakʿah; in the second, the āyah "Say: O People of the Book! Come to common terms as between us and you... (Sūrah Āl ʿImrān, 3:64)."[^204]

Occasionally, he would recite instead of the latter, "When ʿIsā found unbelief on their part...(Sūrah Āl ʿImrān, 3:52)."[^205]

Sometimes he would recite Sūrah al-Kāfirūn (109:6) in the first rakʿah, and sūrah al-Ikhlāṣ (112:4) in the second;[^206] also, he used to say: "An excellent pair of sūrahs they are!"[^207] He heard a man reciting the former sūrah in the first rakʿah, so he said, "This is a slave who believes in his Lord." Then the man recited the latter sūrah in the second rakʿah, so he said, "This is a slave who knows his Lord."[^208]

### Ẓuhr Prayer

"He \pbuh used to recite al-Fātiḥah and two sūrah in the first two rakʿahs, making the first one longer than the second."[^209]

Sometimes he would make lengthen it to the extent that "the Ẓuhr prayer would have started, and someone could go to a plain: al-Baqī, fulfil his need, [come back to his place,] make his ablution, and then come (to the mosque) while the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh was still in the first rakʿah, it was that long."[^210]. Also, "they used to think that he did it so that the people could catch the first rakʿah."[^211]

"He used to recite in each of these two rakʿah about thirty āyāt, such as al-Fātiḥah followed by Sūrah al-Sajdah (32:30)."[^212]

Sometimes "he would recite 'By the Sky and the Night-Visitant (Sūrah Ṭāriq, 86:17),' 'By the Sky, (displaying) the Constellations (Sūrah al-Burūj, 85:22),' 'By the Night as it conceals (Sūrah al-Layl, 92:21)' and similar soorahs."[^213]

Occasionally, he recited "When the Sky is rent asunder (Sūrah al-Inshiqāq, 84:25)" and similar ones.[^214]

"They could tell that he was reciting in Ẓuhr and ʿAṣr from the movement of his beard."[^215]

### Recitation of Āyāt after al-Fātiḥah in the last two rakʿahs

"He used to make the last two rakʿahs about half as long as the first two, about fifteen āyāt,[^216] and sometimes he would recite only al-Fātiḥah in them."[^217]

Sometimes "he would let them hear an āyah or so."[^218]

"They would hear the tones of his recitation of 'Glorify the name of your Lord Most High' (Sūrah al-Aʿlā, 87:19) and 'Has the story reached you of the Overwhelming? (Sūrah al-Ghāshiyah, 88:26).'"[^219]

Sometimes "he would recite 'By the Sky and the Night-Visitant (Sūrah al-Ṭāriq, 86:17),' 'By the Sky, (displaying) the Constellations (Sūrah al-Burūj, 85:22),' and similar soorahs."[^220]

Sometimes "he would recite 'By the Night as it conceals (Sūrah al-Layl, 92:21)' and similar sūrahs."[^221]

### ʿĀṣr prayer

"He \pbuh used to recite al-Fātiḥah and two (other) sūrahs in the first two rakʿahs, making the first one longer than the second,"[^222] and "they used to think that he did it so that the people could catch the rakʿah."[^223]

"He used to recite about fifteen āyāt in each of the first two rakʿahs, about half as much as he recited in each of the first two rakʿahs of Ẓuhr, and he used to make the last two rakʿahs about half as long the first two."[^224]

"He used to recite al-Fātiḥah in the last two."[^225] "He would let them hear an āyah or so sometimes."[^226]

<!-- TODO fix cross-reference -->

He used to recite the sūrahs mentioned under "Ẓuhr prayer" above.

### Maghrib prayer

<!-- TODO double check the word mufassal -->

"He \pbuh used to (sometimes) recite the short mufaṣṣal sūrahs,"[^227] so that "when they had finished praying with him, they could go away and (it was possible to) shoot an arrow and see where it landed."[^228] Once, "while on a journey, he recited 'By the Fig and the Olive (Sūrah al-Tīn, 95:8)' in the second rakʿah."[^229]

But sometimes he would recite the long or medium mufaṣṣal sūrahs, hence "he would recite 'Those who disbelieve and hinder (men) from the Path of Allāh (Sūrah Muḥammad, 47:48);'[^230] or Sūrah al-Ṭūr (52:49);[^231] or Sūrah al-Mursalāt (77:50), which he recited in the last prayer he prayed.[^232]

Sometimes "he would recite the longer of the two long sūrahs[^233] (Sūrah al-Aʿrāf, 7:206) [in two rakʿahs]."[^234] Or he would recite Sūrah al-Anfāl (8:75) in two rakʿahs.[^235]

### Recitation in the sunnah prayer after Maghrib

In this prayer, "he used to recite 'Say: O you who reject faith (Sūrah al-Kāfirūn, 109:6)' and 'Say: He is Allāh, the One and Only (Sūrah al-Ikhlāṣ, 112:4).'"[^236]

### ʿIshāʾ prayer

He \pbuh would recite the medium mufaṣṣal surahs in the first two rakʿahs,[^237] hence "he used to recite 'By the Sun and its splendour (Sūrah al-Shams, 91:15)' and sūrahs like it."[^238]

Or "he would recite 'When the Sky is rent asunder (Sūrah al-Inshiqāq, 84:25)' and make sajdah during it."[^239] Also, "he once recited 'By the Fig and the Olive (Sūrah al-Tīn, 95:8)' [in the first rakʿah] while on a journey."[^240]

He forbade prolonging of recitation in ʿIshāʾ, and that was when:

> Muʿādh ibn Jabal led his people in ʿIshāʾ prayer, and made it very long for them, so one of the Anṣār left and prayed (alone). When Muʿādh was informed about this, he said: "He is surely a hypocrite." When the man heard of this, he went to the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh and told him what Muʿādh had said, so the Prophet \pbuh said to him: "Do you want to be on who causes a lot of trouble, Muʿādh?! When you lead the people, recite 'By the Sun and its splendour (Sūrah al-Shams, 91:15)' or 'Glorify the Name of your Lord Most High (Sūrah al-Aʿlā, 77:19)' or 'Read in the Name of your Lord (Sūrah al-ʿAlaq, 96:19)' or 'By the Night as it conceals (Sūrah al-Layl, 92:21)' [because the old, the weak and those who have a need to fulfil pray behind you]."[^241]

### Night prayer (Tahajjud)

He \pbuh would sometimes recite loudly in it and sometimes quietly,[^242] He \pbuh would shorten his recitation in this sometimes and lengthen it sometimes, occasionally making it so exceedingly long that ʿAbd Allāh ibn Masʿūd once said: "I prayed with the Prophet \pbuh one night, and he carried on standing for so long that I was struck by a wrong idea." He was asked, "What was this idea?" He said: "I thought I would sit down and leave the Prophet \pbuh!"[^243]

Also Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamān said:

> I prayed with the Prophet \pbuh that night when he started Sūrah al-Baqarah (2:{286}). So I said (to myself), "He will make rukūʿ after one hundred āyāt." But he carried on after that, so I thought, "He will finish it (the sūrah) in two rakʿahs." But he carried on, so I thought, "He will make rukūʿ when he has finished it." Then he started Sūrah al-Nisāʾ (4:{176}) and recited it all, then he started Sūrah Āl ʿImrān (3:{200})[^244] and recited it all. He was reciting slowly; when he came to an āyah in which there was glorification of Allāh, he glorified Allāh; at an āyah which had something to be asked for, he asked for it; at mention of seeking refuge, he sought refuge (with Allāh). Then he made rukūʿ...(to the end of the ḥadīth.)[^245]

Also, "one night when he was ill he recited the Seven Long Sūrahs."[^246]

Also, "he would (sometimes) recite one of these surahs in each rakʿah."[^247]

"It was [totally] unknown for him to recite the whole Qurʾān in one night."[^248] In fact, he did not recommend it for ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr when he said to him: "Recite the whole Qurʾān in each month." I said: "I have the power (to do more than that)." He said: "Recite it in twenty nights." I said: "I have the power to do more." He said: "Then recite it in seven days and do not go beyond that."[^249] Then "he allowed him to recite it in five days."[^250] Then "he allowed him to recite it in three days."[^251] Further, he forbade him from reciting it in less time than that,[^252] and he gave a reason for that by saying to him: "Whoever recites the Qurʾān in less than three days does not understand it."[^253] In another version: "He does not understand, the one who recites the Qurʾān in less than three days."[^254] Also when he said to him: "For every worshipper has a (period of) keenness[^255] and every (period of) keenness has a lapse,[^256] either towards a sunnah or towards a bidʿah (innovation); so he whose lapse is towards a sunnah has found guidance, and he whose lapse is towards other than that has been destroyed."[^257]

For this reason, "he \pbuh would not recite the whole Qurʾān in less than three days."[^258]

He used to say: "Whoever prays at night reciting two hundred aayaat will be written down as one of the sincere devotees."[^259] Also, "he used to recite Sūrah Banī Isrāʾīl (17:{111}) and Sūrah al-Zumar (39:{75}) every night."[^260] He also used to say: "Whoever prays at night reciting a hundred āyāt will not be written down as one of the heedless."[^261] Sometimes "he would recite about fifty āyāt or more in each rakʿah,"[^262] or he "would recite about as much as Sūrah al-Muzzammil (73:{20})."[^263]

"He \pbuh would not pray all through the night"[^264] except rarely, for once:

> ʿAbd Allāh ibn Khabbāb ibn al-Arat---who was present at (the Battle of) Badr with the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh---stayed up the whole night with the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh (in another version: a night when he prayed throughout it) until it was dawn. So when he finished his prayer, Khabbāb said to him: "O Messenger of Allāh, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you! Tonight, you have prayed a prayer the like of which I have never seen?" He said: "Yes, it was a prayer of hope and fear; [indeed] I asked my Lord, Mighty and Sublime, three things; He granted me two, but refused me one. I asked my Lord that He would not destroy us the way the nations before us were (in another version: that He would not destroy my Ummah with famine) and He granted me this; I asked my Lord, Mighty and Sublime, that He would not impose on us an enemy from outside us, and He granted me this; and I asked my Lord not to cover us with confusion in party strife, but He refused me this."[^265]

Also, one night he stood (in prayer) repeating one āyah until it was dawn:

> "If You do punish them, they are Your servants; if You do forgive them, You are indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. (Sūrah al-Māʾidah, 5:121)" [with it he bowed, with it he prostrated, and with it he supplicated], [so in the morning Abū Dharr said to him: "O Messenger of Allāh, you did not stop reciting this āyah until it was morning; you bowed with it and you prostrated with it][and you supplicated with it,][whereas Allāh has taught you the whole Qurʾān;] [if one of us were to do this, we would be stern with him?][He \pbuh said: "Indeed I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, for intercession for my Ummah: He granted me it, and it will be possible if Allāh wills for whoever does not associate any partners with Allāh."][^266]

A man said to him: "O Messenger of Allāh, I have a neighbour who stands (in prayer) at night and does not recite anything except 'Say: He is Allāh the One and Only (Sūrah al-Ikhlāṣ, 112:4),' [repeating it,] [not adding anything else,] as if he considers it little." So the Prophet \pbuh said: "By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, it is worth a third of the Qurʾān."[^267]

### Witr prayer

"He \pbuh used to recite 'Glorify the Name of Your Lord Most High (Sūrah al-Aʿlā, 87:{19})' in the first rakʿah, 'Say: O you who disbelieve (Sūrah al-Kāfirūn, 109:{6})' in the second, and 'Say: He is Allāh the One and Only (Sūrah al-Ikhlāṣ, 112:{4})' in the third.[^268] Sometimes he would add on to the last one 'Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Daybreak (Sūrah al-Falaq, 113:{5})' and 'Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Mankind (Sūrah al-Nās, 114:{6}).'[^269] Once, 'he recited a hundred āyāt from Sūrah al-Nisāʾ (4:{176})' in the third rakʿah."[^270]

As for the two rakʿahs after witr,[^271] he used to recite "When the earth is shaken (Sūrah al-Zalzalah, 99:{8})" and "Say: O you who disbelieve (Sūrah al-Kāfirūn, 109:{6})" in them.[^272]

### Friday Prayer

He \pbuh would sometimes recite Sūrah al-Jumuʿah (62:{11}) in the first rakʿah and "When the hypocrites come to you (Sūrah al-Munāfiqūn 63:{11})"[^273] in the second, sometimes reciting "Has the story reached you of the Overwhelming? (Sūrah al-Ghāshiyah 88:{26})" instead of the latter.[^274] Or sometimes "he would recite 'Glorify the Name of your Lord Most High (Sūrah al-Aʿlā 87:{19})' in the first rakʿah and 'Has the story reached you (Sūrah al-Ghāshiyah 88:{26})' in the second."[^275]

### ʿEid Prayer

"He \pbuh would (sometimes) recite 'Glorify the Name of your Lord Most High (Sūrah al-Aʿlā 87:{19})' in the first rakʿah and 'Has the story reached you (Sūrah al-Ghāshiyah 88:{26})' in the second."[^276] Or sometimes "he would recite in them 'Qāāf. By the Glorious Qurʾān. (Sūrah Qāf, 50:{45})' and 'The Hour has drawn near (Sūrah Qamar, 54:{55}).'"[^277]

### Funeral Prayer

"The Sunnah is to recite al-Fātiḥah[^278] [and another sūrah] in it."[^279] Also, "he would be silent for a while, after the first takbeer."[^280]

## Tartīl (Recitation in slow, rhythmic tones), and Making the Voice Beautiful when Reciting

He \pbuh used to recite the Qurʾān in slow, measured rythmic tones as Allāh had instructed him, not racing or hurrying; rather, his was "a recitation clearly-distinguishing each letter,"[^c1] so much so that "he would recite a sūrah in such slow rhythmic tones that it would be longer than would seem possible."[^c2]

He also used to say: "It will be said to the reciter of the Qurʾān (on the Day of Judgment), 'Recite and ascend; recite slowly and rhythmically as you used to do in the previous world; your place will be at the last aayah you recite.'"[^c3]

He "used to prolong his recitation (at a letter which can be prolonged), such as at 'bism Allāh,' at 'al-Raḥmān,' and at 'al-Raḥīm,'"[^c4] and at "nadīd" (Sūrah Qāf, 50:{45})[^c5] and their like.

He used to stop at the end of an āyah, as has already been explained.[^c6]

Sometimes "he would recite in an attractive vibrating tone,[^c7] as he did on the Day of the Conquest of Makkah, when, while on his she-camel, he recited Sūrah al-Fatḥ (48:{29}) [very softly],[^c8] and ʿAbd Allāh ibn Mughaffal narrated this attractive tone thus: aaa."[^c9]

He used to command making one's voice beautiful when reciting the Qurʾān, saying

"Beautify the Qurʾān with your voices [for a fine voice increases the Qur'aan in beauty]"[^c10] and "Truly, the one who has one of the finest voices among the people for reciting the Qurʾān is the one whom you think fears Allāh when you hear him recite."[^c11]

He also used to command recitation of the Qurʾān in a pleasant tone, saying: "Study the Book of Allāh; recite it repeatedly; acquire (memorise) it; and recite it in a melodious tone, for by Him in whose Hand is my soul, it runs away quicker than camels from their tying ropes."[^c12]

He also used to say, "He who does not recite the Qurʾān in a pleasant tone is not of us,"[^c13] and "Allāh does not listen to anything as he listens (in some versions: as he is listening) to a prophet [with a nice voice, and in one version: with a nice melody] who recites the Qurʾān in a pleasant tone[^c14][loudly].[^c15]

He said to Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī,

"Had you seen me while I was listening to your recitation yesterday! You have surely been given one of the musical wind-instruments[^c16] of the family of Dāwūd! [So Abū Mūsā said: 'Had I known you were there, I would have made my voice more pleasant and emotional for you.']"[^c17]

## Correcting the Imām

He \pbuh set the example of correcting the Imām when his recitation becomes mixed up, when once "he prayed, reciting loudly, and his recitation became mixed up, so when he finished, he said to Ubayy: "Did you pray with us?" He replied, "Yes." He said, "So what prevented you [from correcting me]?"[^c18]

## Seeking Refuge and Spitting Lightly during Prayer in order to Repel Temptation

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

ʿUthmān ibn Abī al-Ās said to him, "O Messenger of Allāh! The devil comes between me and my prayer and confuses me in my recitation!" So the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said, "That is a devil called Khinzab, so when you detect him, seek refuge with Allāh from him, and spit lightly[^c19] on your left three times." He said, "So when I did that, Allāh caused him to go away from me."[^c20]
