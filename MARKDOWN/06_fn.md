[^58]: Al-Nawawī says in _Rawdah at-Taalibeen_ (1/224 Maktab al-Islāmī edition):

    "The intention is the purpose, so the person about to pray brings to mind that prayer and what is relevant of its characteristics, such as which prayer it is, whether it is obligatory etc. and he brings these things together in his intention with the first takbīr."

[^59]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim and others. It is given in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (no.\ 22).

[^60]: Muslim and Ibn Mājah. The ḥadīth contains an indication that he did not use to commence it with the words of some people: "I intend to pray, etc." which is in fact agreed to be an innovation. But they differ as to whether it is a good or bad innovation, to which we say: "Indeed all innovations in worship are misguided, from the generality of his statement \pbuh, "and all innovations are misleading, and every misleading thing is in the Fire." But this is not the place for a detailed discussion of this.

[^61]: Al-Ṭabarānī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^62]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Tirmidhī and Ḥākim who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al-Dhahabī agreed. It is given in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (no. 301).

  Literally, "the takbīr makes it ḥarām," i.e. the actions which Allāh has made ḥarām during it, "and the taslīm makes it ḥalāl," i.e. what is allowed outside prayer. Just as the ḥadīth proves that the door to prayer is shut, no worshipper being able to open it except with purification, it similarly proves that the prayer cannot be entered except with takbīr, and that it cannot be exited except with taslīm. This is the view of the majority of scholars.

[^63]: Aḥmad and al-Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al-Dhahabī agreed.

[^64]: Muslim and al-Nasāʾī.

[^65]: Aḥmad and al-Bayhaqī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^66]: Al-Bukhārī and al-Nasāʾī.

[^67]: Ibid.

[^68]: Al-Bukhārī and Abū Dāwūd.

[^69]: Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Khuzaymah (1/62/2, 64/1), Tammām and Ḥākim who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al-Dhahabī agreed.

[^70]: Al-Bukhārī and al-Nasāʾī.

[^71]: Al-Bukhārī and Abū Dāwūd.

[^72]: Muslim and Abū Dāwūd. It is also given in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (352).

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

[^73]: Ibn Ḥibbān and Diyāʾ, with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^74]: Aḥmad and Abū Dāwūd, with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^75]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/54/2) with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, and Ibn Ḥibbān declared it ṣaḥīḥ (485).

[^76]: Mālik, al-Bukhārī and Abū ʿAwānah.

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

[^77]: Al-Nasāʾī and al-Dāraquṭnī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. In this ḥadīth there is evidence that grasping is from the sunnah, and in the previous ḥadīth that so is placing, so both are sunnah. As for the combination of holding and placing, which some of the later Ḥanafīs hold to be good, then that is an innovation; its form as they state is to place the right hand on the left, holding the wrist with the little finger and the thumb, and laying flat the remaining three fingers, as described in Ibn ʿĀbidīn's footnotes on _Durr al-Mukhtaar_ (1/454); so do not be confused by what they say.

[^78]: Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Khuzaymah in his ṣaḥīḥ (1/54/2), Aḥmad and Abū Shaykh in _Tārīkh Isbahaan_ (p.\ 125); Al-Tirmidhī declared one of its isnāds ḥasan, and its meaning is found in _al-Muwaṭṭāʾ_ and _Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī_ if considered carefully. I have fully quoted the isnāds of this ḥadīth in my book _Aḥkām al-Janāʾiz_ (p.\ 118).

    [note:]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"} To place them on the chest is what is proved in the Sunnah, and all that is contrary to it is either ḍaʿīf or totally baseless. In fact, Imām Isḥāq ibn Rāhawayh acted on this sunnah, as Marwazī said in _Masāʾil_ (p.\ 222): "Isḥāq used to pray witr with us and he would raise his hands in qunūt, and make the qunūt before bowing, and place his hands on his breast or just under his breast." Similar is the saying of Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ al-Mālikī in _Mustahabbāt al-Ṣalāh_ in his book _al-Iʿlām_ (p.\ 15, 3rd edition, Rabat): "the right arm is to be placed on the back of the left, on the upper part of the chest." Close to this is what ʿAbd Allah ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal related in his _Masāʾil_ (p.\ 62): "I saw that when praying, my father placed his hands, one on the other, above the navel." See Appendix 4.

[^79]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim. It is given in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (374) as well as the following one.
