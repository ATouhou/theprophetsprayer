[**178]: Tayālisī, Aḥmad and Ibn Abī Shaybah. About **iqaa**, Abū ʿUbaydah and others said, "It is when a man presses his buttocks against the ground, keeps his shins upright, and leans his hands on the ground, the way a dog does." This is different to the **iqaa** between sajdahs, which is approved in the Sunnah, as covered previously.

[**179]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah and others. It is given in _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (316).

[**180]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[**181]: Abū Dāwūd and al--Nasāʾī with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. It is as though the meaning is that he would not separate his elbows from his side, as Ibn al--Qayyim has elucidated in _Zād al--Maʿād_.

[**182]: Bayhaqī and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed. It is given, as well as the next one, in _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (380).

[**185]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah and Ibn Khuzaymah. Humaydī (13/1) and Abū Yaʿlā (275/2) added with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad on the authority of Ibn ʿUmar: "and this is the shooting of the devil; no-one will forget when he does this," and Humaydī raised his finger. Humaydī also said that Muslim bin Abī Maryam said, "A man related to me that in a church in Syria, he saw images of Prophets depicted like this," and Humaydī raised his finger. This is an extremely strange remark, but its sanad up to "the man" is ṣaḥīḥ.

[**186]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[**187]: Abū Dāwūd, al--Nasāʾī, Ibn al--Jārūd in _al--Muntaqā_ (208), Ibn Khuzaymah (1/86/1-2) and Ibn Ḥibbān in his ṣaḥīḥ (485) with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. Ibn al--Mulaqqīn also declared it ṣaḥīḥ (28/2), and it has a supporting narration in Ibn ʿAdī (287/1).

[**188]: Ibid. About "supplicating with it," Imām al--Ṭaḥāwī said, "This is evidence that it was at the end of the prayer." Hence, there is evidence in this that the Sunnah is to continue pointing and moving the finger until the taslīm, for the supplication is until then. This is the view of Mālik and others. Imām Aḥmad was asked, "Should a man point with his finger during prayer?" He replied, "Yes, vigorously." (Mentioned by Ibn Hānī in his _Masāʾil of Imām Aḥmad_, 1/80). From this, it is clear that moving the finger in tashahhud is a proven sunnah of the Prophet \pbuh, and it was practised by Aḥmad and other imāms of the Sunnah. Therefore, those who think that it is pointless and irrelevant and has nothing to do with the Prayer, should fear Allāh, since because of this, they do not move their fingers although they know it to be an established sunnah; and they take great pains to interpret it in a way which is inconsistent with the Arabic way of expression and contrary to the understanding of the imāms with regard to it.

The amazing thing is that some of them will defend an imām on other issues, even if his opinion conflicts with the Sunnah, with the argument that to point out the imām's mistakes inevitably means to taunt and disrespect him. They then forget this and reject this established sunnah, at the same time mocking at those who practise it. Whether or not they realise it, their mockery also includes those imāms whom they often defend wrongly, and who are correct about the Sunnah this time! In
fact, they are deriding the Prophet \pbuh himself, for he is the one who brought us this sunnah, and so jeering at it is equivalent to jeering at him. andlt;andlt; "But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this except..."

As for putting the finger down after pointing, or limiting the movement to the affirmation (saying _lā ilāha_: "there is no god...") and negation (saying: _illallāhu_: "...except Allāh"), all of that has no basis in the Sunnah; in fact, it is contrary to the Sunnah, as this ḥadīth proves.

Further, the ḥadīth that he would not move his finger does not have an authentic isnād, as I have explained in _Ḍaʿīf Abī  Dāwūd_ (175). Even if it were authentic, it is negatory, while the ḥadīth above is affirmatory: the affirmatory takes precedence over the negatory, as is well-known among the scholars.

Hence, the greeting effectively means: "Allāh be a watcher and safeguard over you." Similarly, it is said, "Allāh be with you," i.e. in His safeguarding, help and favour.

[**204]: A term for all the good continuously emanating from Allāh.

[**205]: Al--Bukhārī, Muslim, Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/90/2), Sirāj and Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ (258/2). It is given in _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (321).

Ibn Mas\`ood\'s statement, \"We said: Peace be on the Prophet\" clarifies that the Companions (radi Allāhu \`anhum) used to say, \"Peace be on you, O Prophet\" in tashahhud while the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) was alive, but when he died, they ceased to do that, instead saying, \"Peace be on the Prophet\". Undoubtedly, this was with the endorsement of the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam); this is supported by the fact that \`Aa\'ishah (radi Allāhu \`anhaa) would similarly teach the tashahhud in prayer with \"Peace be on the Prophet\", as transmitted by Siraaj in his Musnad (9/1/2) and Mukhlis in `al-Fawaa'id` (11/54/1) with two ṣaḥīḥ isnāds from her.

Ibn Hajar says, \"This addition shows clearly that they used to say \'Peace be on you, O Prophet\', addressing him directly during his life, but when the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) died, they stopped addressing him and mentioned him in the third person instead, saying \'Peace be on the Prophet\'.\" He also says in a different place, \"Subki said in `Sharh al-Minhaaj`, after mentioning this narration from Abū \`Awaanah only, \'If this is authentically-reported from the Companions, it proves that after his time, it is not compulsory to address the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) directly in the greeting of peace, so one says: Peace be on the Prophet.\' (Ibn Hajar continues:) This is authentic without doubt (i.e. because it is established in Sahih al-Bukhaari ), and I have also found strong support for it:- \`Abdur Razzaaq said: Ibn Juraij informed me: \`Ataa\' informed me that the Companions used to say \'Peace be on you, O Prophet\' while the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) was alive, but after he died, they would say \'Peace be on the Prophet\', and this is a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. As for Sa\`eed bin Mansoor\'s narration from Abū \`Ubaidah bin \`Abdullaah bin Mas\`ood, who reported from his father that the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) taught them the tashahhud, and then he (\`Abdullaah bin Mas\`ood) said it (the tashahhud); Ibn \`Abbaas said: We used to say \'Peace be on you, O Prophet\' only while he was alive, to which Ibn Mas\`ood replied, \'This is how we were taught, and this is how we teach it\', it would appear that Ibn \`Abbaas said this as a matter of discussion but Ibn Mas\`ood did not accept. However, the narration of Abū Ma\`mar (i.e. the narration of Bukhaari ) is more authentic, since Abū \`Ubaidah did not hear (ahaadeeth) from his father, and furthermore, the isnād up to Abū \`Ubaidah is weak.\" (End of quote from Ibn Hajar)

These words of Ibn Hajar have been quoted by several scholars in their analysis, e.g. Qastalaani, Zarqaani, Lucknowi, etc. They all chose to give his words without commenting further. This discussion is treated more fully in `al-Asl`.

[**206]: Muslim, Abū \`Awaanah, Shaafi\`i and al--Nasāʾī.

[**207]: see next note.

[**208]: These two additions have been proved to be part of the tashahhud from the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam). Ibn \`Umar did not add them of his own accord (far is he above such a thing! ); in fact, he learnt them from other Companions who reported them from the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam), and he then added them to the tashahhud which he heard from the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) directly.

[**209]: Abū Dāwūd and Daaraqutni, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ.

[**210]: Muslim, Abū \`Awaanah, Abū Dāwūd and Ibn Maajah.

[**211]: Maalik and Bayhaqī with ṣaḥīḥ isnāds. Although this hadeeth is `mawqoof`, it is effectively `` marfoo` ``, for it is known that this sort of thing is not said from personal opinion, since it were so, it would be no better than any other sayings of `dhikr`, as Ibn \`Abdul Barr has said.

**NB:** In none of the types of tashahhud is there the addition: `wa maghfiratuhu` (... \"and His forgiveness\"), so one should not be accustomed to it. Hence some of the Salaf rebuked it, as the following narrations show:

Tabaraani (3/56/1) reported with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād from Talhah bin Musarrif, who said: Rabee\` bin Khaitham added during tashahhud, \"... and His blessings, `and His forgiveness`\"! So \`Alqamah said, \"We stop where we were taught: Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His blessings\"; \`Alqamah was actually following the example of his teacher \`Abdullaah bin Mas\`ood (radi Allāhu \`anhu), from whom it is authentically-reported that he was teaching a man the tashahhud: when he got to \"I bear witness that there is no (true) god except Allāh ...\", the man said: \"alone, He has no partner\", to which \`Abdullaah said, \"He is so, but we stop at where we were taught.\" (Transmitted by Tabaraani in `` Mu`jam al-Awsat ``, no. 2848, with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.)

[**212]: Abū \`Awaanah in his ṣaḥīḥ (2/324) and al--Nasāʾī.

[**213]: They had said, \"O Messenger of Allāh, we have been taught how to send peace on you (i.e. in tashahhud), but how do we send prayers on you? He said, \"Say: O Allāh! send prayers on Muhammad ...\" etc. Thus he did not specify one tashahhud to the exclusion of another, so there is evidence here to establish sending prayers on him in the first tashahhud also. This is the way of Imaam Shaafi\`i, as in the text of his book `al-Umm`, and it is held to be correct by his companions, as Nawawi has explained in `` al-Majmoo` `` (3/460) and supported in `Rawdah Taalibeen` (1/263). It is also the view of Wazeer bin Hubairah al-Hanbali in al-Ifsaah, as Ibn Rajab ha quoted and strongly supported in `Dhail Tabaqaat` (1/280). Many ahaadeeth exist about sending prayers on him (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) in tashahhud; in none of them is there any such specification mentioned. In fact, these ahaadeeth are general, hence including every tashahhud, and I have given them in al-Asl as ta\`leeq, but not in the main text, for they do not satisfy our conditions for authenticity. However, they do support each other in meaning, and those who reject and oppose this have no authentic evidence to use as proof, as I have detailed in `al-Asl.` Similarly, to say that adding anything to \"O Allāh! send prayers on Muhammad\" is makrooh has no basis in the Sunnah, nor is there any convincing proof for it. In fact, we see that whoever says this does not implement the previous instruction of the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam), \"Say: O Allāh! send prayers on Muhammad, and on the family of Muhammad ...\" ; there is more to this discussion in `al-Asl`.

[**214]:{#fn213}One of the earliest views about the meaning of \"sending prayers on the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam)\" is that of Abū al-\`Aaliyah (with reference to Surah al-Ahzaab, 33:56), \"Allāh\'s sending prayers on his Prophet means His exalting him and raising his rank; the angels\' and others\' sending prayers means their seeking this from Allāh, and here it is meant asking the prayers to be increased, not asking for the original prayer in itself.\" Ibn Hajar quoted this in `Fath al-Baari`, and went on to refute the widespread notion that the Lord\'s prayer on someone is His Mercy; Ibn al-Qayyim also clarified this in `Jalaa' al-Afhaam`, leaving little scope for further comment.

[**215]: from `barakah`: growth, increase. Hence this supplication secures for Muhammad the good which Allāh granted to the family of Ibraaheem, continual, established good, as well as its multiplying and increase.

[**216]: Aḥmad and Tahaawi with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad.

[**217]: see next note.

[**218]: These two additions are conclusively found in Bukhaari, Tahaawi, Bayhaqī, Aḥmad and al--Nasāʾī . They also exist via different routes of narration in other types of this supplication (see nos. 3,7), and so do not be confused by Ibn al-Qayyim\'s view in `Jalaa' al-Afhaam` (p. 198), following in the footsteps of his great teacher Ibn Taymiyyah in `al-Fataawaa` (1/16), \"There is no authentic hadeeth with the phrases \'Ibraaheem\' and \'the family of Ibraaheem\' together\"; here, we have shown you such authentic ahaadeeth. Ibn al-Qayyim\'s error is further established by the fact that he himself declared no. 7 ṣaḥīḥ, which contains what he denied above!

[**219]: Bukhaari, Muslim, Humaydī (138/1) and Ibn Mandah (68/2), who said, \"There is consensus on this hadeeth being authentic.\"

[**220]: Aḥmad, al--Nasāʾī and Abū Ya\`laa in his Musnad (44/2) with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad.

Ibn al-Qayyim gave its source as Muhammad bin Ishaaq as-Siraaj in `Jalaa' al-Afhaam `(pp. 14-15) and then declared it ṣaḥīḥ. This wording includes both \'Ibraaheem\' and \'the family of Ibraaheem\', something overlooked by both Ibn al-Qayyim and his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah, as explained above.

As for the hadeeth, he forbade that a man should support himself with his hand when getting up during prayer\", it is `munkar` and not authentic, as I have explained in `` Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da`eefah `` (967).

[**236]: `Qunoot`: carries several meanings, e.g. humility, devotion. What is meant here is the special supplication while standing during prayer.

[**237]: Bukhaari and Aḥmad.

[**238]: Ibid.

[**239]: Aḥmad and Tabaraani with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. To raise the hands in qunoot is the madhhab of Aḥmad and also Ishaaq bin Raahawaih, cf. Marwazi\'s `Masaa'il` (p. 23). As for wiping the face with the hands, it is not reported in this position, and is thus an innovation; as for outside of prayer, it is not authentically-reported: all that has been transmitted in this regard is either weak or very weak, as I have shown in `` Da`eef Abi       Daawood `` (262) and `Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth as-ṣaḥīḥah` (597). This is why \`Izz bin \`Abd as-Salaam said in one of his fatwas, \"Only an ignorant person does it.\" See Appendix 8.

[**245]: Ibn Nasr and Daaraqutni with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad.

[**246]: We have said, \"... sometimes\" because the Companions who narrated the Witr prayer did not mention the qunoot in it, whereas had the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) done so always, they would have all mentioned it. However, Ubayy ibn Ka\`b alone narrated the qunoot in Witr, so this shows that he used to do it sometimes. Hence, this is evidence that qunoot in Witr is not obligatory (waajib), and this is the opinion of the majority of scholars. For this reason, the researching Hanafi scholar, Ibn al-Humaam, recognised in `Fath al-Qadeer` (1/306,359,360) that the view of it being obligatory is feeble and not substantiated by evidence. This shows his fairness and lack of party-spirit, for this view which he has supported is contrary to his madhhab !

[**247]: Ibn Abī Shaybah (12/41/1), Abū Dāwūd, al--Nasāʾī in `Sunan al-Kubraa` (218/1-2), Aḥmad, Tabaraani, Bayhaqī and Ibn \`Asaakir (4/244/2) narrated this, along with the supplication after it, with a `ṣaḥīḥ` sanad. Ibn Mandah narrated the supplication only in `Tawheed` (70/2) with a different, hasan sanad. Its `takhreej` is also given in `Irwaa'` (426).

[**248]: Ibn Khuzaymah (1/119/2) and also Ibn Abī Shaybah etc., as for the last hadeeth.

**NB:** al--Nasāʾī adds at the end of the qunoot: ``wa sall-Allāhu `ala-n-Nabiyy al-Ummiyy  ``(\"may Allāh send prayers on the Unlettered Prophet\"), related with a weak isnād; among those who declared it da\`eef are Ibn Hajar al-\`Asqalaani and Zurqaani. Therefore, we have not included it in our system of combining acceptable narrations. \`Izz bin \`Abd as-Salaam said in `al-Fataawaa` (66/1,1962), \"To send prayers on the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) in qunoot is not authentic, nor is it fitting to add to the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam)\'s prayer in any way.\" This view of his shows that he did not widen the argument by including the idea of bid\`ah hasanah (\"good\" innovation), as some of the later scholars are prone to doing !

However, it is proved in the hadeeth about Ubayy bin Ka\`b leading the people during the Ramadaan night prayers that he used to send prayers on the Prophet (sallAllāhu \`alaihi wa sallam) at the end of the qunoot, and that was during the reign of \`Umar (radi Allāhu \`anhu) - transmitted by Ibn Khuzaymah in his ṣaḥīḥ (1097). Similarly is proved from Abū Haleemah Mu\`aadh al-Ansaari, who also used to lead them during \`Umar\'s rule - transmitted by Ismaa\`eel al-Qaadi (no. 107) and others, so this addition is justified by the practice of the Salaf, and it is thus not fitting to categorically state that this addition is an innovation. Allāh knows best.
