[^g178]: Tayālisī, Aḥmad and Ibn Abī Shaybah. About **iqaa**, Abū ʿUbaydah and others said, "It is when a man presses his buttocks against the ground, keeps his shins upright, and leans his hands on the ground, the way a dog does." This is different to the **iqaa** between sajdahs, which is approved in the Sunnah, as covered previously.

[^g179]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah and others. It is given in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (316).

[^g180]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[^g181]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Nasāʾī with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. It is as though the meaning is that he would not separate his elbows from his side, as Ibn al-Qayyim has elucidated in _Zād al-Maʿād_.

[^g182]: Al-Bayhaqī and al-Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al-Dhahabī agreed. It is given, as well as the next one, in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (380).

[^g183]: Aḥmad and Abū Dāwūd with a good isnād.

[^g184]: ʿAbd al-Razzāq; ʿAbd al-Ḥaq declared it ṣaḥīḥ in his _Ahkām_ (no.\ 1284---with my checking).

<!-- TODO check humaydi -->

[^g185]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah and Ibn Khuzaymah. Humaydī (13/1) and Abū Yaʿlā (275/2) added with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad on the authority of Ibn ʿUmar: "and this is the shooting of the devil; no-one will forget when he does this," and Humaydī raised his finger. Humaydī also said that Muslim bin Abī Maryam said, "A man related to me that in a church in Syria, he saw images of Prophets depicted like this," and Humaydī raised his finger. This is an extremely strange remark, but its sanad up to "the man" is ṣaḥīḥ.

[^g186]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[^g187]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī, Ibn al-Jārūd in _al-Muntaqā_ (208), Ibn Khuzaymah (1/86/1-2) and Ibn Ḥibbān in his ṣaḥīḥ (485) with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. Ibn al-Mulaqqīn also declared it ṣaḥīḥ (28/2), and it has a supporting narration in Ibn ʿAdī (287/1).

[^g188]: Ibid. About "supplicating with it," Imām al-Ṭaḥāwī said, "This is evidence that it was at the end of the prayer." Hence, there is evidence in this that the Sunnah is to continue pointing and moving the finger until the taslīm, for the supplication is until then. This is the view of Mālik and others. Imām Aḥmad was asked, "Should a man point with his finger during prayer?" He replied, "Yes, vigorously." (Mentioned by Ibn Hānī in his _Masāʾil of Imām Aḥmad_, 1/80). From this, it is clear that moving the finger in tashahhud is a proven sunnah of the Prophet \pbuh, and it was practised by Aḥmad and other imāms of the Sunnah. Therefore, those who think that it is pointless and irrelevant and has nothing to do with the Prayer, should fear Allāh, since because of this, they do not move their fingers although they know it to be an established sunnah; and they take great pains to interpret it in a way which is inconsistent with the Arabic way of expression and contrary to the understanding of the imāms with regard to it.

    The amazing thing is that some of them will defend an imām on other issues, even if his opinion conflicts with the Sunnah, with the argument that to point out the imām's mistakes inevitably means to taunt and disrespect him. They then forget this and reject this established sunnah, at the same time mocking at those who practise it. Whether or not they realise it, their mockery also includes those imāms whom they often defend wrongly, and who are correct about the Sunnah this time! In fact, they are deriding the Prophet \pbuh himself, for he is the one who brought us this sunnah, and so jeering at it is equivalent to jeering at him. andlt;andlt; "But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this except..."

    As for putting the finger down after pointing, or limiting the movement to the affirmation (saying _lā ilāha_: "there is no god...") and negation (saying: _illallāhu_: "...except Allāh"), all of that has no basis in the Sunnah; in fact, it is contrary to the Sunnah, as this ḥadīth proves.

    Further, the ḥadīth that he would not move his finger does not have an authentic isnād, as I have explained in _Ḍaʿīf Abī  Dāwūd_ (175). Even if it were authentic, it is negatory, while the ḥadīth above is affirmatory: the affirmatory takes precedence over the negatory, as is well-known among the scholars.

[^g201]: Arabic _ṣalawāt_, i.e. "all supplications which are used to glorify the majesty of Allāh, for He is fully entitled to them, and none but Him is worthy of them." (_Nihāyah_)

[^g202]: Arabic _ṭayyibāt_: i.e. "all good and pure words suitable for praising Allāh, not those ones incompatible with his attributes with which kings were greeted." (_Fatḥ al-Bārī_)

[^g203]: meaning seeking of refuge with Allāh and being strengthened by him, since _al-Salām_ (Peace) is actually a name of Allāh. Hence, the greeting effectively means: "Allāh be a watcher and safeguard over you." Similarly, it is said, "Allāh be with you," i.e. in His safeguarding, help and favour.

[^g204]: A term for all the good continuously emanating from Allāh.

[^g205]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/90/2), Sirāj and Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ (258/2). It is given in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (321).

    Ibn Masūd's statement, "We said: Peace be on the Prophet" clarifies that the Companions used to say, "Peace be on you, O Prophet" in tashahhud while the Prophet \pbuh was alive, but when he died, they ceased to do that, instead saying, "Peace be on the Prophet." Undoubtedly, this was with the endorsement of the Prophet \pbuh; this is supported by the fact that ʿĀʾishah would similarly teach the tashahhud in prayer with "Peace be on the Prophet," as transmitted by Sirāj in his _Musnad_ (9/1/2) and Mukhlis in _al-Fawāʾiḍ_ (11/54/1) with two ṣaḥīḥ isnāds from her.

    Ibn Ḥajar says, "This addition shows clearly that they used to say 'Peace be on you, O Prophet,' addressing him directly during his life, but when the Prophet \pbuh died, they stopped addressing him and mentioned him in the third person instead, saying 'Peace be on the Prophet.'" He also says in a different place, "Al-Subkī said in _Sharḥ al-Minhāj_, after mentioning this narration from Abū ʿAwānah only, 'If this is authentically-reported from the Companions, it proves that after his time, it is not compulsory to address the Prophet \pbuh directly in the greeting of peace, so one says: "Peace be on the Prophet."'" Ibn Ḥajar continues: "This is authentic without doubt (i.e. because it is established in _Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī_), and I have also found strong support for it: ʿAbd al-Razzāq said: Ibn Jurayj informed me: ʿAtā informed me that the Companions used to say 'Peace be on you, O Prophet' while the Prophet \pbuh was alive, but after he died, they would say 'Peace be on the Prophet,' and this is a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. As for Saʿīd bin Manṣūr's narration from Abū ʿUbaydah bin ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd, who reported from his father that the Prophet \pbuh taught them the tashahhud, and then he (ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd) said it (the tashahhud); Ibn ʿAbbās said: We used to say 'Peace be on you, O Prophet' only while he was alive, to which Ibn Masʿūd replied, 'This is how we were taught, and this is how we teach it,' it would appear that Ibn ʿAbbās said this as a matter of discussion but Ibn Masʿūd did not accept. However, the narration of Abū Maʿmar (i.e. the narration of al-Bukhārī) is more authentic, since Abū ʿUbaydah did not hear (aḥādīth) from his father, and furthermore, the isnād up to Abū ʿUbaydah is weak." (End of quote from Ibn Ḥajar)

    These words of Ibn Ḥajar have been quoted by several scholars in their analysis, e.g. Qastalānū, Zarqānī, al-Lucknowī, etc. They all chose to give his words without commenting further. This discussion is treated more fully in _al-Aṣl_.

[^g206]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, al-Shāfiʿī and al-Nasāʾī.

[^g207]: See next note.

[^g208]: These two additions have been proved to be part of the tashahhud from the Prophet \pbuh. Ibn ʿUmar did not add them of his own accord (far is he above such a thing!); in fact, he learnt them from other Companions who reported them from the Prophet \pbuh, and he then added them to the tashahhud which he heard from the Prophet \pbuh directly.

[^g209]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Dāraquṭnī, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ.

[^g210]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, Abū Dāwūd and Ibn Mājah.

[^g211]: Mālik and al-Bayhaqī with ṣaḥīḥ isnāds. Although this ḥadīth is mawqūf, it is effectively marfūʿ, for it is known that this sort of thing is not said from personal opinion, since it were so, it would be no better than any other sayings of dhikr, as Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr has said.

    [NB]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: In none of the types of tashahhud is there the addition: _wa maghfiratuhu_ (..."and His forgiveness"), so one should not be accustomed to it. Hence some of the Salaf rebuked it, as the following narrations show:

    Al-Ṭabarānī (3/56/1) reported with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād from Ṭalḥah bin Musarrif, who said: Rabīʿ bin Khaytham added during tashahhud, "...and His blessings, and His forgiveness"! So ʿAlqamah said, "We stop where we were taught: 'Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His blessings;'" ʿAlqamah was actually following the example of his teacher ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd, from whom it is authentically-reported that he was teaching a man the tashahhud: when he got to "I bear witness that there is no (true) god except Allāh...," the man said: "alone, He has no partner," to which ʿAbd Allāh said, "He is so, but we stop at where we were taught." (Transmitted by al-Ṭabarānī in _Muʿjam al-Awsaṭ_, no. 2848, with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.)

[^g212]: Abū ʿAwānah in his ṣaḥīḥ (2/324) and al-Nasāʾī.

[^g213]: They had said, "O Messenger of Allāh, we have been taught how to send peace on you (i.e. in tashahhud), but how do we send prayers on you?" He said, "Say: O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad..." etc. Thus he did not specify one tashahhud to the exclusion of another, so there is evidence here to establish sending prayers on him in the first tashahhud also. This is the way of Imām al-Shāfiʿī, as in the text of his book _al-Umm_, and it is held to be correct by his companions, as al-Nawawī has explained in _al-Majmūʿ_ (3/460) and supported in _Rawḍah Ṭālibīn_ (1/263). It is also the view of Wazīr bin Hubayrah al-Ḥanbalī in _al-Ifsāh_, as Ibn Rajab ha quoted and strongly supported in _Dhayl Ṭabaqāt_ (1/280). Many aḥādīth exist about sending prayers on him \pbuh in tashahhud; in none of them is there any such specification mentioned. In fact, these aḥādīth are general, hence including every tashahhud, and I have given them in _al-Aṣl_ as taʿlīq, but not in the main text, for they do not satisfy our conditions for authenticity. However, they do support each other in meaning, and those who reject and oppose this have no authentic evidence to use as proof, as I have detailed in _al-Aṣl_. Similarly, to say that adding anything to "O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad" is makrūh has no basis in the Sunnah, nor is there any convincing proof for it. In fact, we see that whoever says this does not implement the previous instruction of the Prophet \pbuh, "Say: O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad...;" there is more to this discussion in _al-Aṣl_.

[^g214]: One of the earliest views about the meaning of "sending prayers on the Prophet \pbuh" is that of Abū al-ʿAaliyah (with reference to Sūrah al-Aḥzāb, 33:56), "Allāh's sending prayers on his Prophet means His exalting him and raising his rank; the angels and others sending prayers means their seeking this from Allāh, and here it is meant asking the prayers to be increased, not asking for the original prayer in itself." Ibn Ḥajar quoted this in _Fatḥ al-Bārī_, and went on to refute the widespread notion that the Lord's prayer on someone is His Mercy; Ibn al-Qayyim also clarified this in _Jalāʾ al-Afhām_, leaving little scope for further comment.

[^g215]: from _barakah_: growth, increase. Hence this supplication secures for Muḥammad the good which Allāh granted to the family of Ibrāhīm, continual, established good, as well as its multiplying and increase.

[^g216]: Aḥmad and al-Ṭaḥāwī with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad.

[^g217]: See next note.

[^g218]: These two additions are conclusively found in al-Bukhārī, al-Ṭaḥāwī, al-Bayhaqī, Aḥmad and al-Nasāʾī. They also exist via different routes of narration in other types of this supplication (see nos. 3 and 7), and so do not be confused by Ibn al-Qayyim's view in _Jalāʾ al-Afhām_ (p. 198), following in the footsteps of his great teacher Ibn Taymiyyah in _al-Fatāwā_ (1/16), "There is no authentic ḥadīth with the phrases 'Ibrāhīm' and 'the family of Ibrāhīm' together;" here, we have shown you such authentic aḥādīth. Ibn al-Qayyim's error is further established by the fact that he himself declared no. 7 ṣaḥīḥ, which contains what he denied above!

[^g219]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Humaydī (138/1) and Ibn Mandah (68/2), who said, "There is consensus on this ḥadīth being authentic."

[^g220]: Aḥmad, al-Nasāʾī and Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ (44/2) with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad.

[^g222]: Al-Bukhārī, al-Nasāʾī, al-Ṭaḥāwī, Aḥmad and Ismāʿīl al-Qāḍī in _Faḍl al-Ṣalāh ʿalā Nabī \pbuh_ (p.\ 28 1st\ ed., p.\ 62 2nd\ ed.---with my checking).

[^g224]: Al-Nasāʾī, al-Ṭaḥāwī, Abū Saʿīd bin al-ʿArabī in _al-Muʿjam_ (79/2) with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. Ibn al-Qayyim gave its source as Muḥammad bin Isḥāq al-Sirāj in _Jalāʾ al-Afhām_ (pp.\ 14--15) and then declared it ṣaḥīḥ. This wording includes both 'Ibrāhīm' and 'the family of Ibrāhīm,' something overlooked by both Ibn al-Qayyim and his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah, as explained above.

[^g236]: _Qunūt_: carries several meanings, e.g. humility, devotion. What is meant here is the special supplication while standing during prayer.

[^g239]: Aḥmad and al-Ṭabarānī with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. To raise the hands in qunūt is the madhhab of Aḥmad and also Isḥāq bin Rāhawayh, cf. Marwazī's _Masāʾil_ (p. 23). As for wiping the face with the hands, it is not reported in this position, and is thus an innovation; as for outside of prayer, it is not authentically-reported: all that has been transmitted in this regard is either weak or very weak, as I have shown in _Ḍaʿīf Abī Dāwūd_ (262) and _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (597). This is why ʿIzz bin ʿAbd al-Salām said in one of his fatwas, "Only an ignorant person does it." See Appendix 8.

[^g240]: Abū Dāwūd and Sirāj; Al-Ḥākim declared it ṣaḥīḥ, and al-Dhahabī and others agreed.

[^g241]: Abū Dāwūd, Sirāj and al-Dāraquṭnī with two ḥasan sanads.

[^g242]: Ibn Khuzaymah in his ṣaḥīḥ (1/78/2) and Khatīb in _Kitāb al-Qunūt_ with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad.

[^g243]: Al-Bukhārī and Aḥmad; the addition is in Muslim.

[^g244]: Al-Nasāʾī, Aḥmad, Sirāj (109/1) and Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ with a good sanad.

[^g245]: Ibn Naṣr and al-Dāraquṭnī with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad.

[^g246]: We have said, "...sometimes" because the Companions who narrated the Witr prayer did not mention the qunūt in it, whereas had the Prophet \pbuh done so always, they would have all mentioned it. However, Ubayy ibn Kaʿb alone narrated the qunūt in Witr, so this shows that he used to do it sometimes. Hence, this is evidence that qunūt in Witr is not obligatory (wājib), and this is the opinion of the majority of scholars. For this reason, the researching Ḥanafī scholar, Ibn al-Humām, recognised in _Fatḥ al-Qadīr_ (1/306, 359, 360) that the view of it being obligatory is feeble and not substantiated by evidence. This shows his fairness and lack of party-spirit, for this view which he has supported is contrary to his madhhab!

[^g247]: Ibn Abī Shaybah (12/41/1), Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī in _Sunan al-Kubrāʾ_ (218/1-2), Aḥmad, al-Ṭabarānī, al-Bayhaqī and Ibn ʿAsākir (4/244/2) narrated this, along with the supplication after it, with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. Ibn Mandah narrated the supplication only in _Tawḥīd_ (70/2) with a different, ḥasan sanad. Its takhrīj is also given in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (426).

[^g248]: Ibn Khuzaymah (1/119/2) and also Ibn Abī Shaybah etc., as for the last ḥadīth.

    [NB]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: Al-Nasāʾī adds at the end of the qunūt: _wa sall-Allāhu ʿalā al-Nabīyy al-Ummīyy_ ("may Allāh send prayers on the Unlettered Prophet"), related with a weak isnād; among those who declared it ḍaʿīf are Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī and Zurqānī. Therefore, we have not included it in our system of combining acceptable narrations. ʿIzz bin ʿAbd al-Salām said in _al-Fatāwā_ (66/1, 1962), "To send prayers on the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh in qunūt is not authentic, nor is it fitting to add to the Messenger of Allāh's \pbuh prayer in any way." This view of his shows that he did not widen the argument by including the idea of bidʿah ḥasanah ("good" innovation), as some of the later scholars are prone to doing!

    However, it is proved in the ḥadīth about ʿUbayy bin Kaʿb leading the people during the Ramaḍān night prayers that he used to send prayers on the Prophet \pbuh at the end of the qunūt, and that was during the reign of ʿUmar---transmitted by Ibn Khuzaymah in his _Ṣaḥīḥ_ (1097). Similarly is proved from Abū Halīmah Muʿādh al-Anṣārī, who also used to lead them during ʿUmar's rule---transmitted by Ismāʿīl al--Qāḍī (no. 107) and others, so this addition is justified by the practice of the Salaf, and it is thus not fitting to categorically state that this addition is an innovation. Allāh knows best.
