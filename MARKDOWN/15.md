## The Tasleem (Salutation of Peace)

Next, "he (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would salute to his right:

**Peace and Allāh's Mercy be on you** [such that the whiteness of his right cheek was visible,], and on his left:

**Peace and Allāh's Mercy be on you** [such that the whiteness of his left cheek was visible]."[^277]

Sometimes, he would add to the greeting on the right:

**... and His blessings (be on you).**[^278]

"When he said:

**Peace and Allāh's Mercy be on you** to his right, he would sometimes shorten the greeting on his left to:

**Peace be on you.**[^279]

Sometimes, "he would salute once only, [

**Peace be on you**] [in front of his face, turning to his right side a bit,][or a little]."[^280]

"They used to gesture with their hands when saluting to the right and left; when the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) saw them, he said, **'What is the matter with you, gesturing with your hands as if they are the tails of wild horses?! When one of you salutes, he should look towards his companion and not indicate with his hand.'** [So when they prayed with him, they did not gesture.] (In one narration: **It is enough for each of you to place his hand on his thigh, and then salute his brothers who are on his right and left**).[^281]

### The Obligation of the Tasleem

He (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) used to say, ... it (the prayer) is exited by the tasleem.[^282]

This is the last of what has been possible to compile regarding the description of the Prophet's prayer (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) from the takbeer to the tasleem: I hope that Allāh will make it sincerely for His Face, Full of Honour, and a guide to the Sunnah of His kind and merciful Prophet.

Glorified be Allāh, and Praised. Glorified be You, O Allāh, and Praised. I bear witness that there is no true god except You. I seek forgiveness from You and repent to You.

O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, and send blessings on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as You sent prayers on Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.[^283]
