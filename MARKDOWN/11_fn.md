[^e78]: Al--Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^e79] Abū Dāwūd and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

[^e80] Abu Yaʿlā in his Musnad (284/2) with a good isnād and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/79/2) with a different, ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^e81] Al--Nasāʾī, al--Dāraquṭnī and Mukhlis in _al--Fawāʾ'id_ (1/2/2) with two ṣaḥīḥ isnāds. This raising of the hands has been reported from ten Companions, and a number of the Salaf viewed it as correct, among them Ibn ʿUmar, Ibn ʿAbbās, Ḥasan al--Baṣrī, Tāwūs, his son ʿAbd Allāh, Nāfiʿ the freed slave of Ibn ʿUmar, Sālim the son of Ibn ʿUmar, Qāsim bin Muḥammad, ʿAbd Allāh bin Dīnār and ʿAtāʾ. Also, ʿAbd al--Raḥmān bin Mahdī said, "This is from the Sunnah," it was practised by the Imām of the Sunnah, Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal, and it has been quoted from Mālik and al--Shāfiʿī.

[^e82] Ibn Khuzaymah (1/76/1), al--Dāraquṭnī and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed. All the aḥādīth which contradict this are inauthentic. This way has been endorsed by Mālik, and similar is reported from Aḥmad in Ibn al--Jawzī's _al--Taḥqīq_ (108/2). Also, al--Marwazī quoted with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, Imām al--Awzāʾī in his _Masāʾil_ (1/147/1) as saying, "I found the people placing their hands before their knees."

[^e83] Abū Dāwūd, Tammām in _al--Fawāʾid_, and al--Nasāʾī in _Sunan al--Ṣughrā_ and _Sunan al--Kubrā_ (47/1) with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. ʿAbd al--Ḥaqq declared it ṣaḥīḥ in _al--Aḥkām_ (54/1), and went on to say in _Kitāb al--Tahajjud_ (56/1), "it has a sounder isnād than the previous one," i.e. the ḥadīth of Wāʾil which is the other way round (knees before hands). In fact, the latter ḥadīth, as well as being contradictory to this ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth and the preceding one, is neither authentic in isnād nor in meaning, as I have explained in _Silsilah al--aḥādīth al--Ḍaʿīfah_ (no. 929) and _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (357).

    It should be known that the way to differ from the camel is to place the hands before the knees, because the camel places its knees first; a camel's "knees" are in its forelegs, as defined in _Lisān al--ʿArab_ and other books of the Arabic language, and as mentioned by al--Ṭaḥāwī in _Mushkil al--Āthār_ and _Sharḥ Maʿānī al--Āthār_. Also, Imām Qāsim al--Saraqustī narrated in _Gharīb al--Ḥadīth_ (2/70/1-2), with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, Abū Hurayrah's statement, "No one should kneel the way a runaway camel does," and then added, "This is in sajdah. He is saying that one should not throw oneself down, as a runaway (or untamed) camel does, hurriedly and without calmness, but he should go down calmly, placing his hands first, followed by his knees, and an explanatory marfūʿ ḥadīth has been narrated in this regard." He then mentioned the ḥadīth above.

    As for Ibn al-Qayyim's extremely strange statement, "These words are incomprehensible, and not understood by the experts of the language," it is answered by the sources which we have mentioned, and also many others which can be consulted. I have also expanded on this in the refutation against Shaykh Tuwayjarī, which may be published.

[^e84] Ibn Khuzaymah(1/79/2), Aḥmad and Sirāj; Ḥākim declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed. It is given in _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (313).

[^e85] Abū Dāwūd and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

[^e86]{#fn85}Ibn Khuzaymah, Bayhaqī and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

[^e87] Bayhaqī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/82/2) and Sirāj have related the pointing of the toes in a different narration.

[^e88] Abū Dāwūd and al--Tirmidhī, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ, as did Ibn al--Mulaqqin (27/2); it is given in _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (309).

[^e94] Bayhaqī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/82/2) and Sirāj have related the pointing of the toes in a different narration.

[^e95] Al--Bukhārī and Abū Dāwūd. Ibn Saʿd (4/157) related from Ibn ʿUmar that he liked to point whatever of his body he could towards the qiblah when praying, even his thumbs.

[^e96] Al-Ṭaḥāwī, Ibn Khuzaymah (no. 654) and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

[^e98] Al--Tirmidhī and Sirāj; Ḥākim declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

[^e99] This movement of the hand was deduced from the grammar of the Arabic text (_Fath al--Bārī_).

[^e100] i.e. to draw them in and prevent them from being scattered, meaning to gather the garment or hair with the hands for rukūʿ and sujūd (_Nihāyah_). This forbiddance is not only during prayer; the majority of scholars include tucking in the hair and garments before prayer in the prohibition. This is further strengthened by his forbidding men to pray with their hair tied, which follows later.

[^e101] Al--Bukhārī and Muslim. It is given in _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (310).

[^e102] Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah and Ibn Ḥibbān.

[^e103] i.e. tied up or plaited.

[^e104] Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah and Ibn Ḥibbān. Ibn al--Athīr says, "The meaning of this ḥadīth is that were his hair loose, it would fall on the ground when in sajdah; hence, the man would be rewarded for the prostration of the hair. However, if the hair is tied, it is effectively as though it did not prostrate, for he compared him to someone whose hands are shackled together, since they would then not lie on the ground in sajdah."

    It would seem that this instruction is limited to men and does not apply to women, as al--Shawkānī has quoted from Ibn al-ʿArabī.

[^e105] Abū Dāwūd and al--Tirmidhī, who declared it ḥasan; Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Ḥibbān declared it ṣaḥīḥ. See _Ṣaḥīḥ Abī Dāwūd_ (653).

[^e128] Al--Nasāʾī, Ibn ʿAsākir (4/257/1-2) and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

[^e129] Ibn Khuzaymah in his ṣaḥīḥ, with a ḥasan isnād from Ibn Masʿūd (887) and Bayhaqī in mursal form. Ibn Khuzaymah prefixed it with, "Chapter: evidence that gesturing which is understood during prayer neither invalidates nor spoils the prayer" -- this action is one which the People of Opinion have prohibited! In this regard, there are also aḥādīth in al--Bukhārī, Muslim and others.

[^e130] i.e. its colour is pure black, with no other colours mixed with it (_Nihāyah_).

[^e131] The whiteness refers to that part of the horse where chains and bangles are put, including the lower legs but not the knees.

[^e132] i.e. the shining of the face due to the light of sujūd.

[^e133] i.e. the shining of the parts covered in ablution: the face, hands and feet. The shining marks of ablution on the face, hands and legs of humans is compared to the whiteness of a horse's face and legs.

[^e134] Aḥmad, with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. Al--Tirmidhī related a part of it and declared it ṣaḥīḥ. It is given in _Silsilah al--Aḥādīth al--Ṣaḥīḥah_.

[^e135] Al--Bukhārī and Muslim; the ḥadīth shows that the sinful from among those regular at Prayer, will not remain the Fire forever; in fact, even those given to missing prayers out of laziness will not remain in the Fire forever, this is authentic -- see _Silsilah al--Aḥādīth al--Ṣaḥīḥah_ (2054).

[^e136] Arabic _hasīr_: a mat made of date-palm leaves or straw, etc.

[^e137] This was because his mosque was not covered with mats, etc. This is evident from a great many aḥādīth, such as the next one and the one of Abū Saʿīd later.

[^e138] Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[^e139] Aḥmad, Sirāj and Bayhaqī, with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^e140] Al--Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^e141] Ibid. A _khumrah_ is a piece of matting, palm-fibre, or other material which is big enough for a man to place his face on it in sajdah; the term does not apply to larger pieces.

[^e142] Ibid.

[^e143] Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah. Arabic _labisa_: usually means 'to wear,' but here it is used to mean 'to use,' i.e. to sit on; hence 'wearing' includes 'sitting on,' so this indicates that it is prohibited (ḥarām) to sit on silk, because of the prohibition on wearing it established in the Ṣaḥīḥs of al--Bukhārī and Muslim, and others. In fact, a clear forbiddance of sitting on silk is related in these, so do not be confused by the fact that some leading scholars allow it.

[^e144] Al--Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^e145] Abū Dāwūd and Ḥākim who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

[^e146] Al--Bukhārī in his _Juzʾ Rafʿ al--Yadayn_, Abū Dāwūd with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah. It is given in _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (316).

    To raise the hands here, and with every takbīr, was a view voiced by Aḥmad, as in Ibn al--Qayyim's _Badaa'i_ (3/89): "Athram quoted from him (Imām Aḥmad) that on being asked about raising the hands, he said: 'With every movement down and up.' Athram said: 'I saw Abu ʿAbd Allāh (i.e. Imām Aḥmad) raising his hands in prayer with every movement down and up.'"

    This was also the opinion of Ibn al--Mundhir and Abū ʿAlī of the Shāfiʿīs, and also a view of Mālik and al--Shāfiʿī themselves, as in _Tarh at--Tathreeb_. The raising of the hands here is also authentically reported from Anas bin Mālik, Ibn ʿUmar, Nāfiʿ, Tāwūs, Ḥasan Baṣrī, Ibn Sīrīn and Ayyūb al--Sikhtiānī, as in _Musannaf Ibn Abī Shaybah_ (1/106) with ṣaḥīḥ narrations from them.

[^e147] Aḥmad and Abū Dāwūd with a good isnād.

[^e148] Al--Bukhārī and Bayhaqī.

[^e149] Al--Nasāʾī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^e150] Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, Aūu Shaykh in _Mā Rawāhu Abū al--Zubayr ʿan Ghayr Jābīr_ (nos. 104-6) and Bayhaqī.

[^e151] Ibid. Ibn al--Qayyim overlooked this, so after mentioning the Prophet's \pbuh iftirāsh between the two sajdahs, he said, "No other way of sitting here is preserved from him!" How can this be correct, when **iqaa** has reached us via: the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿAbbās in Muslim, Abū Dāwūd and al--Tirmidhī, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ, and others (see _Silsilah al--Aḥādīth al--Ṣaḥīḥah_ 383); the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿUmar with a ḥasan isnād in Bayhaqī, declared ṣaḥīḥ by Ibn Ḥajar. Also, Abū Isḥāq al--Ḥarbī related in _Gharīb al--Ḥadīth_ (5/12/1) from Tāwūs, who saw Ibn ʿUmar and Ibn ʿAbbās practising **iqaa**; its sanad is ṣaḥīḥ. May Allāh shower His Mercy on Imām Mālik, who said, "Every one of us can refute and be refuted, except the occupant of this grave," and he pointed to the grave of the Prophet \pbuh. This sunnah was practised by several Companions, Successors and others, and I have expanded on this in _al--Aṣl_.

    Of course, this **iqaa** is different to the one which is forbidden, and follows under "Tashahhud."

[^e152] Abū Dāwūd and Bayhaqī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.

[^e153] Abū Dāwūd and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

[^e154] Al--Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^e155] Ibid. Ibn al--Qayyim said, "This sunnah was abandoned by the people after the time of the Companions. But as for the one who abides by the Sunnah, and does not glance sideways towards whatever contradicts it, he is unworried by anything opposing this guidance."

[^e156] Abū Dāwūd, al--Tirmidhī, Ibn Mājah and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed.

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

[^e157] Ibn Mājah with a ḥasan sanad. Imām Aḥmad chose to supplicate with this one; Isḥāq bin Rāhawayh said, "If he wishes, he can say this three times, or he can say 'O Allāh! Forgive me...,' because both of them have been reported from the Prophet \pbuh between the two sajdahs." (_Masāʾil of Imām Aḥmad and Isḥāq bin Rāhawayh as related by Isḥāq al--Marwazī_, p. 19).

[^e158] This does not negate the validity of the expressions in the obligatory prayers due to the absence of anything to differentiate between those and voluntary prayers. This is the view of al--Shāfiʿī, Aḥmad and Isḥāq, who held that this was allowed in compulsory and voluntary prayers, as al--Tirmidhī has narrated. Imām al--Ṭaḥāwī has also taken this view in _Mushkil al--Āthār_. Proper analysis supports this argument, for there is no position in prayer where a dhikr is not valid, and so it is fitting that this should be the case here.

[^e159] Al--Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^e160] Abū Dāwūd and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al--Dhahabī agreed; the addition is from al--Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^e166] Al--Bukhārī and Abū Dāwūd. This sitting is known as _jalsah al--istirāhah_ (the sitting of rest) by the scholars of fiqh. Al--Shāfiʿī supported it, as did Aḥmad in _Taḥqīq_ (111/1) and favoured it more strongly, as is well-known of him that he would insist on following a sunnah which had nothing to contradict it. Ibn Hānī said in his _Masāʾil of Imām Aḥmad_ (p. 42), "I saw Abū ʿAbd Allāh (i.e. Imām Aḥmad) sometimes leaning on his hands when standing up for the next rakʿah, and sometimes sitting straight and then getting up." It was also the preference of Imām Isḥāq bin Rāhawayh, who said in Marwazī's _Masāʾil_ (1/147/2), "The example was set by the Prophet \pbuh of supporting himself with his hands when getting up, whether he was old or young." See also _Irwāʾ al--Ghalīl_ (2/82-3).

[^e167] Al--Bukhārī and al--Shāfiʿī.

[^e168] literally, "as one who kneads dough."

<!-- TODO double check the following -->

[^e169] Abū Isḥāq al--Ḥarbī with a faultless sanad, and its meaning is found in Bayhaqī with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. As for the ḥadīth, "He used to get up like an arrow, not supporting himself with his hands," it is mawḍū (fabricated), and all narrations of similar meaning are weak, not authentic, and I have explained this in _Silsilah al--Aḥādīth al--Ḍaʿīfah_ (562, 929, 968).
