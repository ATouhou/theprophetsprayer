All that has been mentioned of the description of the Prophet's prayer \pbuh applies equally to men and women, for there is nothing in the Sunnah to necessitate the exception of women from any of these descriptions; in fact, the generality of his \pbuh statement, “Pray as you have seen me praying,” includes women.

This is the view of Ibrāhīm al-Nakhaʿī, who said, “A woman's actions in the prayer are the same as a man's”---transmitted by Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/75/2), with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_ from him.

Also, al-Bukhārī reported in _al-Tārīkh al-Ṣaghīr_ (p.\ 95) with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_ from Umm al-Dardāʾ, “that she used to sit in her prayer just as a man sits, and she was a woman of understanding.”

The _ḥadīth_ about the _inḍimām_ (tucking up) of a woman in prostration, and that she is in that regard not like a man, is _mursal_ and not authentic. Abū Dāwūd transmitted it in _al-Marāsīl_ on the authority of Yazīd ibn Abī Ḥabīb.

As for what Imām Aḥmad has reported, as in his son ʿAbd Allāh's _Masāʾil_, from Ibn ʿUmar, that he used to instruct his wives to sit cross-legged in prayer, its _sanad_ is not authentic, for it contains ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar al-ʿAmrī, who is a _ḍaʿīf_ (weak) narrator.
