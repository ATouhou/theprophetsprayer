[^14]: i.e. the ʿAsr prayer according to the correct saying of the majority of scholars, among them Abū Ḥanīfah and his two students. There are aḥādīth about this which Ibn Kathīr has given in his Tafsīr of the Qurʾān.

[^18]: Ibid. Khaṭṭābī said, "The meaning of ʿImrān's ḥadīth is intended for a sick person who is able to undergo hardship and stand with difficulty. Hence the reward of praying sitting has been made half of the reward of praying standing: encouraging him to pray standing while allowing him to sit." Ibn Ḥajr said in _Fatḥ al-Bārī_ (2/468): "This deduction is valid."

[^19]: Aḥmad and Ibn Mājah with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad.

[^22]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ, as did al-Dhahabī. I have given it in _al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (319) and _Irwāʾ_ (383).

[^23]: Muslim and Abū Dāwūd.

[^24]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^32]: Ibid.

[^33]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/110/2) with a ṣaḥīḥ isnaad.

[^34]: This is the sunnah about the pulpit: that it should have three steps, not more, To have more is an innovation, from the period of Banī ʿUmayyah, which often causes an interruption in the row, and to get out of that by having it in the western corner of the mosque or in the miḥrāb is another innovation, as is the raising of it in the wall like a balcony to which one ascends by means of steps in the wall! Whereas the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad \pbuh. See _Fatḥ al-Bārī_ (2/331).

[^35]: al-Bukhārī, Muslim (who collected the other narration) and Ibn Saʿd (1/253). It is given in _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ (545).

[^41]: Al-Bukhārī. The sutrah is a must for the Imām or a person praying alone, even in a large mosque. Ibn Hānī said in his _Masāʾil_ from Imām Aḥmad (1/66): "Abū ʿAbd Allāh (i.e. Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal) saw me one day when I was praying without a sutrah in front of me, and I was in a (large) congregational mosque, so he said to me: 'Take something as a sutrah', so I took a man as a sutrah." This contains an indication that Imām Aḥmad did not differentiate between big or small mosques in taking a sutrah---and that is surely correct, but this is something neglected by most people, including imāms of mosques, in every land that I have visited, including Arabia which I was able to tour in Rajab of this year (1410 [ah]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}), so the ʿUlamā should tell the people and advise them of this, explaining its ruling and that it is also required in the Two Sacred Mosques.

[^51]: Referring to the following prayer of the Prophet Sulaymān which was answered by Allāh, as described in the Qurʾān: "My Lord! Forgive me, and grant me sovereignty not allowed to anyone after me, for You are indeed the Granter of Bounties. So we subjected to his power: the Wind, gently flowing to his order, wherever he wished; and the devils, every kind of builder and diver, and also others bound together in fetters." (Sūrah Ṣāḍ, 38:35--38)

[^52]: Aḥmad, al-Dāraquṭnī and al-Ṭabarānī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, and similar in meaning to this ḥadīth is found in al-Bukhārī and Muslim and others on the authority of several Companions. It is one of the many aḥādīth which the Qādiyānī group disbelieve, for they do not believe in the world of the jinn which is mentioned in the Qurʾān and the Sunnah. Their method of discarding the texts is well-known: if it is from the Qurʾān, they change its meaning e.g. the saying of the Exalted: "Say, it has been revealed to me that a group of jinns listened" (72:1); they say "i.e. a group of humans"! making the word _jinn_ synonymous with "human"! Hence they play with the language and the religion; if it is from the Sunnah, then if it is possible for them to change it with a false interpretation they do so, otherwise they find it easy to declare it to be false, even if all the Imāms of Ḥadīth and the whole Ummah behind them are agreed on its authenticity, nay its being mutawātir. May Allāh guide them.

[^53]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim, and the additional narration is from Ibn Khuzaymah (1/94/1).

[^54]: Ibid.

[^55]: i.e. mature, and what is meant by "cut off" is "rendered futile." As regards the ḥadīth: "Nothing cuts off the prayer," then it is a weak ḥadīth as I have shown in _Tamām al-Minnah_ (p.\ 306).

[^56]: Muslim, Abū Dāwūd and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/95/2).
