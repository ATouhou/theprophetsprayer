# The Second Rak'ah

"When he \pbuh got up for the second rakʿah, he would commence with 'All Praises be to Allāh (Sūrah al--Fātiḥah, 1:1),' without pausing."[^170]

He would perform this rakʿah exactly as he performed the first, except that he would make it shorter than the first, as mentioned before.

## The Obligation of Reciting Sūrah al--Fātiḥah in every Rakʿah

He ordered "the one who prayed badly" to recite al--Fātiḥah in every rakʿah, when he said to him after ordering him to recite it in the first rakʿah,[^171] then do that throughout your prayer[^172] (in one narration: in every
rakʿah).[^173] He also used to say, "There is recitation in every rakʿah."[^174]
