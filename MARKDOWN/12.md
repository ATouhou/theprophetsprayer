# The Second Rakʿah

"When he \pbuh got up for the second rakʿah, he would commence with 'All Praises be to Allāh (Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:1),' without pausing."[^f170]

He would perform this rakʿah exactly as he performed the first, except that he would make it shorter than the first, as mentioned before.

## The obligation of reciting _al-Fātiḥah_ in every _rakʿah_

He ordered "the one who prayed badly" to recite al-Fātiḥah in every rakʿah, when he said to him after ordering him to recite it in the first rakʿah,[^f171] then do that throughout your prayer[^f172](in one narration: in every rakʿah).[^f173] He also used to say, "There is recitation in every rakʿah."[^f174]
