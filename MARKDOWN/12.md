## The Second Rak'ah

"When he (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam) got up for the second rak'ah, he would commence with All Praise be to Allāh (Faatihah 1:1), without pausing."[^170]

He would perform this rak'ah exactly as he performed the first, except that he would make it shorter than the first, as before.

### The Obligation of Reciting Soorah al-Faatihah in every Rak'ah

He ordered "the one who prayed badly" to recite al-Faatihah in every rak'ah, when he said to him after ordering him to recite it in the first rak'ah[^171], **then do that throughout your prayer**[^172] (in one narration: **in every
rak'ah**).[^173] He also used to say, **There is recitation in every rak'ah.**[^174]
