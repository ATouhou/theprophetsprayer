# Intention and Takbīr

He \pbuh used to say: “All actions are by intention,[^58] and every man shall have what he intended.”[^59]

---

Then he \pbuh would commence the prayer by saying:

<!-- TODO fix this -->

<!-- ![](/images/salah/101.gif)   -->

“Allāh is the Greatest.”[^60]

He ordered “the man who prayed badly” to do likewise as has been mentioned, and he said to him: “Verily, the prayer of a person is not complete until he has made an ablution which has included the necessary parts of the body and has then said: ‘Allāhu Akbar.’”[^61]

He would also used to say: “The key to the prayer is purification, it is entered by _takbīr_ and exited by _taslīm_.”[^62]

Also, “he used to raise his voice for the _takbīr_ such that those behind him could hear.”[^63] But, “when he fell ill Abū Bakr used to raise his voice to convey the _takbīr_ of the Messenger \pbuh to the people.”[^64]

He would also say: “When the Imam says: ‘Allāhu Akbar,’ then say, ‘Allāhu Akbar.’”[^65]

## Raising the hands

He would raise his hands sometimes with the _takbīr_,[^66] sometimes after the _takbīr_,[^67] and sometimes before it.[^68]

“He would raise them with fingers apart [not spaced out, nor together],”[^69] and “he would put them level with his shoulders,”[^70] although occasionally, “he would raise them until they were level with [the tops of] his ears.”[^71]

## The command to place the right arm on the left arm

“He \pbuh used to place his right arm on his left arm,”[^72] and he used to say: “We, the company of prophets, have been commanded to hasten the breaking of the fast, to delay the meal before the fast, and to place our right arms on our left arms during prayer.”[^73]

Also “he passed by a man who was praying and had placed his left arm on his right, so he pulled them apart and placed the right on the left.”[^74]

## To place the hands on the chest

“He used to place the right arm on the back of his left palm, wrist and forearm,”[^75] “and he commanded his companions to do likewise,”[^76] and (sometimes) “he would grasp his left arm with his right.”[^77]

“He used to place them on his chest.”[^78]

Also “he used to forbid putting one's hand on the waist during prayer [and he put his hand on his waist (to demonstrate)].”[^79] And this is the _silb_ (cross) which he used to forbid.[^80]
